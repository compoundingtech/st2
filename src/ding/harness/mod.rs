//! Per-harness composer adapters behind one positional rule.
//!
//! A pane has exactly one live composer and it is the lowest one on screen; anything
//! composer-shaped above it is scrollback, typically a captured screen from the other harness.
//! Asking every harness where its composer is and then classifying the lowest makes that a single
//! comparison rather than a special case per harness pair, and it means adding a harness cannot
//! reintroduce a preference ordering.
//!
//! Active-turn and modal detection is per-harness on purpose: the shapes are harness-specific TUI
//! chrome, not a shared contract. Only genuinely cross-harness shapes stay in `composer`.
