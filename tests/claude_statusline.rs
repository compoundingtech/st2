#![cfg(unix)]

//! The Claude status-line tee, exercised as Claude runs it: `hooks/claude-statusline.sh` as the
//! process, with the payload on stdin and the operator's renderer downstream.
//!
//! These assert the tee's exact stdout bytes rather than the record it happens to write, because
//! the failure HC-R18 names is invisible from the record's side. Claude's `statusLine` is a single
//! slot whose winning declaration replaces the others outright — measured against 2.1.250,
//! `.claude/settings.local.json` (the file st2 materializes) beats both `.claude/settings.json` and
//! `~/.claude/settings.json`, and the losing command never runs. So a tee that records perfectly
//! and forgets to chain leaves every managed agent with a blank status line, and a test that only
//! checked the record would be green throughout.
//!
//! Stdout is the renderer's channel and nothing else may reach it. The renderer's bytes, or no
//! bytes: a warning, a diagnostic, or the raw payload written there interleaves with the
//! operator's line, which is why the assertions are on exact bytes and not on substrings. The
//! degraded arms therefore assert stdout is EMPTY and take their positive evidence from stderr,
//! where the diagnostic goes and where Claude never renders.
