//! The file-lock transport: `flock` on a named lock file, released when the guard drops.
//!
//! Every persistent cross-process lock in this tree was the same three system calls — open the lock
//! file, `flock` it, close it — hand-rolled around wildly different protocols, each with its own
//! `unsafe` block and its own `impl Drop`. This module owns those three calls, and deliberately
//! nothing else:
//!
//! * It returns [`std::io::Result`] and never `anyhow`, so every caller keeps the exact context
//!   string its own protocol reports. Wrapping here would flatten eight distinct diagnostics into
//!   one and make the lock file's identity unrecoverable from the message.
//! * `Ok(None)` means contention and nothing else. Every other failure is an `Err`, so a caller
//!   cannot mistake a lock file it may not open for a lock file somebody else is holding.
//! * It does not create directories, does not `fsync`, and does not name lock files. Those are
//!   protocol: the callers legitimately disagree about all three (one creates the parent, one
//!   requires the parent to be `0700` first, one names its lock by suffixing a foreign config
//!   path), and absorbing the disagreement here would hide it rather than resolve it.
//! * [`open`] and [`FileLock::hold`] stay split, because the window *between* the open and the
//!   `flock` is load-bearing: [`crate::catalog_lock`] writes its contention checkpoints there, and
//!   [`crate::resource_profile`] proves the opened lock is a regular file there.
//!
//! The defaults are [`crate::resource_profile`]'s publication lock, the one site that was already
//! correct on every axis, so they are house style rather than invention: `O_RDWR` (a path that
//! cannot be opened for write is not usable as this tree's lock file, and a shared lock is still
//! taken on a writable descriptor), `O_NOFOLLOW` so a symlink planted at the lock path cannot
//! redirect the lock domain to a file its planter also holds, `O_CLOEXEC` — which Rust's
//! `OpenOptions` already sets, named in the call only so a reader does not go looking for it — and
//! creation mode `0600`.
