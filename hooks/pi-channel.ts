// st2 native message delivery for the pi harness.
//
// pi has no MCP and no app-server. Its integration point is an extension loaded into the live
// interactive process, which is strictly better than either: `pi.sendUserMessage()` is a typed
// injection point and `ctx.isIdle()` is a positive idle proof, so st2 never inspects a screen to
// decide whether delivery is safe.
//
// This asset is published as part of st2's immutable content-addressed hook set and referenced from
// a launch as `<verified set>/pi-channel.ts`. It deliberately holds no policy: st2 decides which
// message is delivered, how (`deliverAs` travels on the frame), and what a starting session is told
// about its own durable state (`sessionContext` travels on the hello). This file only moves frames.
//
// It fails open in both directions. An unmanaged pi session — one started by a human, with none of
// the channel environment set — loads this extension and does nothing. A channel that does not
// answer in time starts the session anyway, without restored context, rather than hanging it.
