//! Controlled omp launch with a session-owned presence lease.
//!
//! omp is pi-family: its integration point is a pi-style extension loaded into the interactive
//! process, which reaches st2 by spawning `st2 driver omp-channel` (`hooks/omp-channel.ts`,
//! forked from the pi channel — see `docs/vrs/06-omp-driver/spec.md` for the measured
//! divergences). The wrapper owns presence for the same reason the pi wrapper does: the extension
//! lives only as long as omp's process, and a SIGKILL of omp produces no terminal record at all,
//! so presence decays by staleness exactly as for the other harnesses.
//!
//! Unlike pi, the wrapper hard-gates the provider version (OMP-R05): the delivery-critical
//! surface — event names, the sampled idle edge, the approval events — is versioned behavior, not
//! an API contract, so an unverified MINOR stays refused until the admission checks are repeated.
//! Patches inside an admitted minor launch without new evidence (decision 0007).
