//! Harness context: the driver-owned numeric record of how full an agent's context window is.
//!
//! A `harness-context` file sits beside `harness-state` at the agent-directory root and carries
//! the fill triple (`usedTokens`, `windowTokens`, `usedPercent`), the compaction triple
//! (`compactions`, `lastCompactionMs`, `lastCompactionTrigger`), and the adjacent facts the same
//! producer channel supplies for free (`model`, `costUsd`, `rateLimits`, `sessionTotalTokens`).
//! It is the *numeric* axis; [`crate::harness_state`] owns the *categorical* one and reads none of
//! this. Both are independent of declared presence.
//!
//! It borrows that module's transport — a cross-process lock, stage-and-rename, an embedded origin
//! timestamp never file mtime, byte-distinct content on every landed write — and deliberately does
//! **not** borrow its ownership machinery: no claim sequence, no written claim, no floor sidecar,
//! no terminal record, no derived `unknown`. Those exist because a *state* record can lie in a
//! dangerous direction — a straggler resurrecting `active` makes a reader believe a dead seat is
//! working. A straggler writing a stale token count says only "this number is older than you
//! think", which the record's own timestamp already says. `incarnation` is carried as PROVENANCE
//! and never consulted as a fence (HC-T04, HC-R15).
//!
//! Two properties follow from the axis rather than from the transport:
//!
//! - **A stale reading is returned, not derived away** (HC-R06). There is no `unknown` vocabulary
//!   here: past the horizon a reader gets the numbers it found, marked `stale`, with their age.
//!   "190k of 200k, twelve minutes ago" is useful; "active, twelve minutes ago" is not, which is
//!   why the sibling record derives and this one does not.
//! - **The write guard is quantization, not equality** (HC-R09, HC-R10). A reading lands when it
//!   enters a different 1% bucket of the window, crosses Claude account-window exhaustion, when
//!   a compaction happens, or when the record is older than the heartbeat. Writes per window fill
//!   are therefore capped at
//!   `100 / HARNESS_CONTEXT_BUCKET_PERCENT` however chatty the producer is, which is what lets one
//!   constant serve all five harnesses; the bounded exhaustion and reset edges bypass that cap.
//!
//! The only st2 classification derived from these numbers is the positive fresh Claude rate-limit
//! signal used by roster consumers; the raw readings remain advisory for a human, a roster, and
//! Doctor.
