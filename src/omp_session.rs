//! Controlled omp launch with a session-owned presence lease.
//!
//! omp is pi-family: its integration point is a pi-style extension loaded into the interactive
//! process, which reaches st2 by spawning `st2 driver omp-channel` (`hooks/omp-channel.ts`,
//! forked from the pi channel — see `docs/vrs/06-omp-driver/spec.md` for the measured
//! divergences). The launch body itself is shared with pi in [`crate::pi_family_session`].
//!
//! Unlike pi, the wrapper hard-gates the provider version (OMP-R05): the delivery-critical
//! surface — event names, the sampled idle edge, the approval events — is versioned behavior, not
//! an API contract, so an unverified MINOR stays refused until the admission checks are repeated.
//! Patches inside an admitted minor launch without new evidence (decision 0007-omp-is-a-fifth-native-driver-with-its-own-channel-and-a-hard-version-gate).
