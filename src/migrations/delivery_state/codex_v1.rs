//! `st2.codex-delivery-state.v1` — the Codex driver's own delivery record, written by every
//! release before `st2.delivery-ledger.v1`.

//! Its loader `ensure!`d its schema and denied unknown fields, so it refuses to start on anything
//! it does not recognize. That is why the canonical record is a new filename rather than a bump of
//! this one, and why nothing here writes: this file only reads bytes an older binary left.
