//! One stage-and-rename publication primitive for the state-plane records.
//!
//! Nine helpers in eight modules each staged a sibling and renamed it over the target, with their
//! own temp-name scheme and their own answer to the parts that actually matter: whether the
//! staging file is created exclusively, what mode it carries, and whether a failed staging is
//! cleaned up. The line count was never the problem — deciding the same security question nine
//! times and getting nine answers was, most visibly as the defect fixed in #502 (a predictable
//! staging name, created non-exclusively, in an agent-writable directory).
//!
//! Three things stay with the caller, deliberately:
//!
//! - **Serialization.** Callers pass bytes. The absorbed helpers serialize three different ways
//!   (`to_vec`, `to_vec` plus a newline, `to_writer` plus a newline); a `json` entry point here
//!   would have to reproduce all three to keep every record byte-identical, so the module would
//!   carry the difference instead of removing it.
//! - **The staging-name prefix.** The grammar is `{prefix}.tmp-{pid}-{counter}` and it is
//!   load-bearing, not decorative: `.status.tmp-` is matched by prefix in six catalog and
//!   publication walkers, `.message.tmp-` in four sent-record walkers, and
//!   `.harness-context.tmp-<pid>-<counter>` is parsed digit by digit by
//!   [`crate::harness_context::is_legacy_staging_name`] under INVARIANTS row 29. A module that
//!   invented its own names would silently turn staged files into durable replicated keys.
//! - **Error context.** Every function returns [`io::Result`], never `anyhow`, so each callsite
//!   keeps the exact context string it already had.
//!
//! Five publishers deliberately do **not** use this module, because each holds a strictly stronger
//! primitive than a path-based stage-and-rename can express:
//! `catalog_transaction::atomic_replace_file` and `agent_publish::{atomic_write_spec,
//! atomic_publish_staged_bundle}` publish through a retained control-directory fd with `EXDEV`
//! fault injection and error classification; `resource_profile::atomic_replace_at` and
//! `event::write_record` use `openat`/`renameat` against a retained directory capability;
//! `codex_app_server::atomic_json` chmods its state directory to `0700` on every write and emits
//! pretty JSON. `pretrust::write_atomic` also stays out for the opposite reason: it publishes
//! files st2 does not own (`~/.claude.json`, `~/.codex/config.toml`), where tightening a foreign
//! config's mode has no argument behind it.
