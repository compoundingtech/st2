# Source eval migration review

Date: 2026-08-28

Source: `compoundingtech/evals` at `3db48ab56d40ce27dfd94f89d2db9b692d93836a`.

This review covers all 58 active source evals. It also considers the four evals that the source already retired.

The source repository calls these units cells. This repository calls each unit an eval.

## Recommendation

Archive the source repository after the selected evals and evidence enter this repository.

Do not copy every eval as KDL. Product behavior with strong Rust coverage belongs in the Rust suite.

Use one logical eval for one behavior. A Claude or Codex variant is a harness choice, not a new eval.

The proposed result has 19 logical evals. Sixteen logical evals now have both runtime forms.

- The review started with three logical evals represented here.
- Sixteen new logical evals come from 18 source evals.
- Three source evals merge into retained evals.
- Twelve source evals remain as Rust coverage.
- Nineteen research, overlapping, or rejected-control evals do not enter the active corpus.

The source catalog lists accepted pass evidence for seven evals. Most evals have no structured run record.

Selection therefore depends on the product contract. It does not depend only on a historic green result.

The final corpus has ten model-free evals and nine paid evals. The nine paid evals include the three original evals.

## Paid eval admission rule

A paid eval must expose a unique product failure. A cheaper Rust or model-free test must not cover the same failure.

The eval must have a strong held-out judge. A vague model-quality score does not earn a place in the active corpus.

The eval must also have a named run trigger. We do not run every paid eval after every change.

A candidate remains outside the active corpus until one baseline run proves that its judge works.

## Decision terms

`Represented` means that the behavior already has an st2 and an st3 form in this repository.

`Keep` means that the fixture enters this repository with rewritten KDL for the current design.

`Merge` means that another logical eval should absorb the unique assertions.

`Rust` means that we should not keep a second KDL copy. The named Rust tests own the contract.

`Archive` means that the source Git history remains the record. The active corpus does not copy the eval.

## Complete classification

| Source eval | Decision | Target or owner | Reason |

| `assignment-contract-hot-assignment` | Archive | Source history | This old Assignment wrapper was an experimental control. It is not an st3 plan assignment. |

## Why the selected resource evals survive

The nine assignment evals form a three-by-three experiment. The source project selected direct named resources.

The Focus and old Assignment forms remain controls. They should not become new st3 product layers.

This decision does not remove plan assignment from st3. An st3 plan step still has an explicit agent assignment.

The new model-free evals should test three different events:

- A cold assignment becomes ready and creates one delivery action.
- A live assignment receives a new resource target and later becomes idle.
- One subject loses authority before another subject receives authority.

The evals should inspect plans, resources, claims, and Small Talk actions directly. They should not pay models to confirm mechanical state.

## Why the VRS pairs do not enter the active corpus

The eight VRS evals form four matched prompt experiments. They test the effect of governance documents on model behavior.

That research can remain useful. It is not a runtime acceptance contract, and none of the pairs has structured run evidence.

The archived repository preserves the fixtures and judges at the pinned commit. We can later create a separate research corpus.

We can also reuse an individual task after we define a clear runtime question. We should not carry the A/B structure by default.

## Migration rules

Each selected agent eval must use a native `harness` block. A fixture process can still use `command`.

Each selected logical eval gets an st2 form and an st3 form.

A model-free pair uses native runtime records to prove the same outcome. Its report names all tested binary versions.

The st3 form must lift the work plan, step state, assignment, products, and judges into the graph.

The graph must hold durable work state. Agent prose and a private todo file must not be the only state.

The combined restart eval distinguishes at-least-once execution from one accepted product for each stable work ID.

The st3 form must use Small Talk for direct coordination. It must not add a private message channel.

Codex `gpt-5.6-sol` is the default model judge. A specific eval can choose a Claude judge and record the reason.

Do not add an old-KDL adapter. Translate a selected st2 KDL before st3 publishes it.

Every paid run must add a dated report. The report records duration, token use, graph transitions, messages, and judge results.

## Migration order

Wave 1 proves the runtime:

1. Maintain the ten represented model-free lifecycle, PTY, network, resource, and crash pairs.
2. Add threaded-reply and delegation assertions to License MIT.
3. Maintain Restart continuity with duplicate delivery and durable graph state.
4. Maintain Fork in the road with its parallel drafts, debate, revisions, and synthesis in the graph.

Wave 2 broadens agent work:

1. Maintain Poisoned pull request as the review-only and security eval.
2. Import Test writing as the mutation-scored quality eval.
3. Import Weird Git setup as the worktree launch eval.
4. Import Claude skill inheritance as a provider integration eval.

Rust-owned evals do not wait for these waves. Before source archival, run their named suites and close any missing assertion.

## Paid run triggers

| Eval | Unique paid value | Run trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `license-mit` | Claude team startup, delegation, threaded Small Talk, and confirmation | Claude harness, Small Talk, or delegation changes |
| `ghost-bug` | The cheapest Codex multi-agent debugging path | Routine Codex team smoke testing |
| `signal-rename` | A complex plan with parallel code work, products, integration, and a green review state | Plan graph, dependency, product, or multi-agent changes |
| `fork-in-the-road` | Parallel independent analysis followed by synthesis of a real tradeoff | Concurrency and synthesis milestones only |
| `restart-continuity` | Cold restart, duplicate delivery, and durable graph progress in one scenario | Restart, redelivery, lease, or durable work-state changes |
| `poisoned-pr` | A review-only lane with a hard security finding and request-changes verdict | Review judgement or review-only lane changes |
| `test-writing` | Mutation scoring detects coverage theater | Judge execution, fixture isolation, or result-report changes |
| `weird-git-setup` | A real linked-worktree launch and commit boundary | Workspace, worktree, or launch-path changes |
| `claude-skill-inheritance` | Actual project and plugin skill loading in the Claude harness | Claude package, plugin, or project-skill changes |

## Archive gate

The source repository can become read-only when all items below are true:

- Each `Keep` row exists here or has an explicit removal decision.
- Each `Rust` row has green named coverage on supported platforms.
- Imported source evidence includes its source commit and original run receipts.
- The local inventory generates from the embedded corpus.
- The old overnight runner has no unique production duty.
- The source repository README points to this repository and its exact corpus location.
- One final script proves that all 58 active source evals have one decision in this review.

The four source-retired evals remain retired: `clean-compose`, `compose-config-load`, `compose-global-skill`, and `team-standup`.
