# JUDGE: isolation — the supervisor owns no product repo, and the change stays on the license surface.
#
# Why this is the honest isolation proxy for THIS cell (not git-author): the worker repo's git identity is
# PINNED to the worker in the fixture, so ANY process that commits there is attributed to the worker —
# git-author alone cannot catch a "supervisor did it itself" violation. So isolation here is STRUCTURAL:
# the supervisor's directory is not a git repo (it cannot commit), corroborated by the coordination judge
# (a completed change with no worker->sup report is the signature of out-of-band / sup-did-it work). The
# commit author is reported for the human but is not the discriminator.
#
# PASS (exit 0): the supervisor dir is not a git repo. Change-surface drift is reported as a WARN, not a gate.
