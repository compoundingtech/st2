//! Controlled pi launch with a session-owned presence lease.
//!
//! pi has no MCP and no app-server: its integration point is an extension loaded into the
//! interactive process, and that extension reaches st2 by spawning `st2 driver pi-channel`. Two
//! facts have to be handed to it, and neither is discoverable from inside pi. The first is *which*
//! st2 to run — resolving `st2` from `PATH` would let a replaced control plane and its live agents
//! disagree, which the R11 control-plane replacement guarantee exists to prevent — so the wrapper
//! exports its own executable path. The second is the catalog and identity the channel must bind.
//!
//! The wrapper also owns presence for the same reason the Claude wrapper does: the extension lives
//! only as long as pi's process, and a measured SIGKILL of pi produces no terminal record at all
//! (`docs/vrs/.experiments/2026-08-18-pi-harness-integration.md`). Presence therefore decays by
//! staleness, exactly as for the other harnesses.
