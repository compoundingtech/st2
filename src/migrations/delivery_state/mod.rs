//! Translation of the per-driver `delivery-state.json` records into
//! [`crate::delivery_ledger::Carried`] entries.
//!
//! Before `st2.delivery-ledger.v1`, each native transport kept its own single-binding record at
//! `<state-dir>/delivery-state.json` holding one `{binding, filename, correlation, phase in
//! {Attempted, Accepted}}`. The two records had the same field *shape* and different meanings:
//! Codex wrote `Accepted` only from the typed `item/completed{userMessage, clientId}` inside a
//! turn (the model received it), OpenCode from `GET /session/{s}/message/{m}` returning 200 (the
//! server stored it). Nothing on disk said which. That difference — and the field spellings, and
//! the filename, and the schema strings — lives here and nowhere else.
//!
//! One file per legacy version: [`codex_v1`], [`opencode_v1`]. Each owns its wire struct, the
//! meaning of its labels, and a `TryFrom<Adopting<Record>> for Carried`. A future
//! `delivery-state.v2` would be one more file plus one match arm in [`recover`].
//!
//! Two properties make this safe to translate rather than migrate in place:
//!
//! * **Fresh namespace.** The canonical record is a different filename, so nothing is rewritten
//!   and a translation can be re-derived from bytes that are still there.
//! * **Phase, not label.** Every entry this module produces is graded no higher than the
//!   evidence the old record actually carried, and no harness
//!   [`Profile`](crate::delivery_ledger::Profile) proves `Attempted`, so a carried-forward
//!   attempt suppresses a duplicate and authorizes no transport. The canonical transaction
//!   loader re-checks that against the profile and fails closed, so the safety argument is
//!   enforced by the canonical validator, not by care taken here.
//!   [`crate::delivery_ledger::asserted`] additionally marks each entry
//!   [`crate::delivery_ledger::Attestation::Asserted`], which changes no decision and exists to
//!   make the leftover countable — see the trigger below.
//! * **Tokenless by construction.** A [`crate::delivery_ledger::Carried`] entry carries no
//!   attempt token. Minting one here would mean this module choosing a fence for an attempt it
//!   never watched; the canonical loader derives it deterministically from the row's own bytes
//!   under the transaction lock instead (Q35).
//!
//! # Deletion trigger
//!
//! `docs/vrs/.delta/DELTA-006-delivery-state-v1-arm.md`, whose Resolution Signal is produced by
//! [`resolution_signal`] and printed per seat by `st2 doctor`: no `delivery-state.json` beside a
//! ledger and no ledger entry still carrying an asserted phase, on every admitted host, for
//! seven days. Deleting this arm is this directory, the one seam statement in the canonical
//! transaction loader, and the attestation instrumentation the trigger needed. The local half of
//! the trigger is [`tests::deletion_trigger_absent_old_record_makes_this_module_a_no_op`]; the
//! signal itself is pinned by
//! [`tests::the_resolution_signal_counts_each_clause_without_consuming_it`].
