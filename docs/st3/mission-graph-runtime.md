# st3 mission graph runtime

Status: current language and runtime specification.

See [kdl-lifecycle.md](./kdl-lifecycle.md) for complete day-to-day publication workflows.

Every st3 KDL document starts with `version 2`. Declarations follow the version directly.

A mission is an immutable definition in the claims graph. Publishing a mission does not start it.

A mission run has one stable subject. Each immutable run generation binds that run to one exact mission revision.

## Core rules

- A mission has `draft`, `ready`, or `retired` state.
- Only a ready mission can start.
- A mission needs one through three `goal` nodes.
- A step accepts zero through three `goal` nodes.
- Missions and steps can repeat `baseline` and `gate`.
- Missions and steps can contain one `produces` block.
- All sibling products must exist. All sibling gates must pass.
- A mission completes only through its explicit `completion` block.
- A mission without `completion` stays open after its available work is exhausted.
- `depends-on` defines execution order. Source order defines display order only.
- A missing `depends-on` makes a step a root. It does not imply a dependency on the previous step.
- st3 rejects missing step references and dependency cycles.
- st3 does not accept `outcome`, `judges`, or `judge`.
- `assigned-to` and `available-to` can set a mission default or select one step.
- `agentless` is step-only. A step with no inherited selector is also agentless.
- A selector does not grant revision authority.
- A mission allows one active run by default.
- `concurrent-runs` enables concurrent active runs. An optional `max` property bounds them.
- A mission can declare exact text and resource inputs.
- A mission can declare one absolute run `timeout`.
- An eval entry mission must declare a timeout no greater than 20 minutes.

## Complete example

```kdl
version 2

mission "release" state="ready" revisions="human-only" revision-reviewer="person/nathan" revision-cutover="when-idle" {
    input "source" kind="resource"
    goal "Produce a verified release decision."
    goal "Keep the source and test evidence visible in the graph."
    completion { when "all-steps-exhausted" }

    agent "release.lead" {
        workspace "${ST_WORKSPACE}/lead"
        harness "codex" {
          model "gpt-5.6-sol"
          effort "medium"
        }
    }
    agent "release.test" {
        under "release.lead" reason="the lead combines the test evidence"
        workspace "${ST_WORKSPACE}/test"
        harness "codex" {
          model "gpt-5.6-sol"
          effort "medium"
        }
    }

    baseline "the release request is ready" {
      field "status" "${input.source}" "is" "ready"
    }

    produces {
      resource "mission-run/${ST_MISSION_RUN}/release-decision" {
        kind "custom.st3.release-decision"
        state "published"
      }
    }

    gate "the requester approves the release" type="human" {
      reviewer "person/nathan"
      question "Is this release ready?"
      review "resource/mission-run/${ST_MISSION_RUN}/release-decision"
    }

    step "start-team" {
      agentless
      title "The release team is ready"
      gate "the lead exists" { exists "agent/${ST_MISSION_RUN}/release.lead" }
      gate "the test agent exists" { exists "agent/${ST_MISSION_RUN}/release.test" }
    }

    step "inspect" timeout="20m" {
      title "The source is inspected"
      goal "Inspect the exact release source and publish an inspection report."
      assigned-to "agent/${ST_MISSION_RUN}/release.lead"
      depends-on { step "start-team" completed }
      produces {
        resource "mission-run/${ST_MISSION_RUN}/inspection" {
          kind "custom.st3.release-inspection"
          state "published"
        }
      }
      gate "the report contains a revision" {
        field "revision" "resource/mission-run/${ST_MISSION_RUN}/inspection" "starts-with" "git:"
      }
    }

    step "verify" timeout="20m" {
      title "The release decision is verified"
      goal "Run the tests and publish the final release decision."
      assigned-to "agent/${ST_MISSION_RUN}/release.test"
      depends-on { step "inspect" completed }
      retry { attempts 2; backoff "30s" }
      gate "the release tests pass" {
        exec "./verify-release.sh"
        host "local"
        workspace "${ST_WORKSPACE}/test"
        time-limit "5m"
      }
    }
}
```

The mission body owns the complete mission revision. Its agents use stable subjects inside one mission run.

The mission baseline protects the run admission boundary. The inspection product is intermediate step output.

The release decision is a final mission product. The human gate is a mission-level acceptance condition.

After acceptance, cleanup stops both agents before the run becomes completed.

## Mission syntax

```kdl
mission "MISSION_ID"
  state="ready"
  timeout="2h"
  revisions="human-only"
  revision-reviewer="person/reviewer"
  revision-cutover="when-idle" {
  goal "One measurable mission goal."
  goal "An optional second goal."
  goal "An optional third goal."
  constraint "A mission-specific rule for this work."

  input "message" kind="text"
  input "source" kind="resource"
  concurrent-runs max=4

  assigned-to "agent/${ST_MISSION_RUN}/owner"
  // Or repeat available-to. A mission cannot declare agentless.

  completion { when "all-steps-exhausted" }
  // Or: completion { depends-on { step "publish" completed } }

  baseline "NAME" { GRAPH_PREDICATE }
  produces { PRODUCT... }
  gate "NAME" { GATE_BODY }

  MISSION_AGENTS...

  step "STEP_ID" { ... }
  finally { step "CLEANUP_ID" { ... } }
}
```

The `state` property is required for a top-level mission. A nested mission defaults to ready because it is already part of a submitted parent revision.

Mission IDs can contain path separators. Step IDs cannot. IDs cannot be empty, contain whitespace, start or end with `/`, or contain `//`.

Mission goal order is preserved. Each mission must have one, two, or three goals.

A mission can repeat constraints, baselines, and gates. Gate and baseline names must be unique within that mission. A mission has at most one `produces` block.

A mission can repeat `input`. Each input name is unique and uses `kind="text"` or `kind="resource"`.

The input set and kinds cannot change across revisions of an active run. Input values remain immutable across all run generations.

The default active run limit is one. Bare `concurrent-runs` removes the limit. `concurrent-runs max=4` sets a positive limit.

When active revisions declare different limits, st3 uses the strictest limit. A lower limit does not cancel existing runs.

An exact idempotent retry returns its existing run before the capacity check. A direct start error lists the active run subjects.

`revisions="human-only"` is optional and inherited by child steps. `revision-reviewer` requires that protection.

The reviewer defaults to the mission run requester. `revision-cutover` is `restart-active` by default or `when-idle` when declared. The value in the current generation controls how its successor starts; a candidate cannot select its own cutover.

A mission can contain direct declarations. Direct agents in the mission can revise the complete mission.

A mission can contain zero steps. A zero-step mission without `completion` becomes standing after reconciliation.

`timeout` is optional for an ordinary mission. It starts when the mission run is created and applies to the complete run, not one step or generation. A revision cannot extend or reset the stored deadline.

The daemon arms an exact wake for the nearest deadline. It does not depend on a client process or periodic polling. At expiry, st3 fails the run, terminates descendant runs, skips remaining normal and final work, removes run-owned runtime state, and records the timeout as the eval failure reason when the run is an eval.

Every eval entry mission needs a timeout of 20 minutes or less. The store enforces this rule for both the eval API and a directly published eval-mode mission run.

`completion` accepts one shortcut or one dependency block. The two forms cannot appear together.

`when "all-steps-exhausted"` selects all normal steps without listing them. Failed retryable work is not exhausted.

The dependency form uses the same explicit dependency language as a step. It can select a smaller completion frontier.

A completion dependency cannot reference a final step.

Without `completion`, the mission never becomes terminal because it exhausted its steps.

## Run ownership and concurrency

A mission run is the sole owner of execution state. An agent cannot exist outside a mission run.

The origin of the `mission-run.created` claim advances the mission run. It also materializes the run declarations.

A replica stores the run and its steps. It can accept eligible work claims, but it does not evaluate the run.

This rule prevents two nodes from creating different local runtimes for one replicated run. An explicit member `host` can place work elsewhere.

An authored runtime ID is local to the run. st3 expands it to these subjects:

- `agent/RUN/LOCAL_ID`;
- `exec/RUN/LOCAL_ID`;
- `pty/RUN/LOCAL_ID`;
- `observer/RUN/LOCAL_ID`;
- `subscription/RUN/LOCAL_ID`;
- `schedule/RUN/LOCAL_ID`.

Two concurrent runs can use the same local IDs. Two declaration sites in one generation cannot declare the same runtime subject.

An open mission keeps its runtimes present. This rule supports long-lived chat agents without a second mission type.

A runtime `stop` can occur only inside the owner mission. Root control uses a named mission-run `cancellation` instead.

The default mission permits one nonterminal run. This default also lets `st3 mission show MISSION` identify the current run.

Bare `concurrent-runs` permits unlimited nonterminal runs. `concurrent-runs max=N` sets a positive limit.

The capacity check runs after the idempotency check. A child start waits when capacity is full, but a direct start returns `mission-run-capacity`.

Missions and agents do not support in-place ownership changes. Publish a replacement mission and cancel the old run when ownership must change.

## Step syntax

```kdl
step "STEP_ID" timeout="20m" revisions="human-only" revision-reviewer="person/reviewer" {
  title "A display title"
  goal "One optional goal."
  goal "A second optional goal."
  goal "A third optional goal."
  constraint "A step-specific rule for this work."
  available-to "agent/${ST_MISSION_RUN}/worker-a"
  available-to "agent/${ST_MISSION_RUN}/worker-b"
  document "doc/project/request@SHA256"

  depends-on {
    step "earlier-step" completed
  }

  baseline "NAME" { GRAPH_PREDICATE }
  DESIRED_STATE...
  mission "nested-work" { ... }
  retry { attempts 3; backoff "30s" }
  produces { PRODUCT... }
  produces-mission "generated-mission"
  uses-mission output-of="producer-step"
  gate "NAME" { GATE_BODY }
}
```

`title`, `assigned-to`, `agentless`, `mission`, `retry`, `produces`, `produces-mission`, and `uses-mission` are single fields.

`available-to`, `goal`, `constraint`, `document`, `depends-on`, `baseline`, and `gate` can repeat. A step accepts at most three goals.

`timeout` applies to the complete step attempt. A step cannot use a deadline gate because its timeout is the one step deadline.

If a step produces a native harness driver, the step waits for a ready, working, or idle harness observation. A driver declared with `restart "never"` that exits, vanishes, or fails to start before that observation fails the step immediately. A restartable driver remains pending while its restart policy can still recover it and fails the step when that policy raises an unrecoverable decision. The step timeout is a containment bound, not a reason to hide an already terminal driver for the rest of the interval.

`finally {}` contains final-phase steps. Final steps run after normal success, failure, or cancellation.

A mission can have one `finally` block. Final steps can depend on other final steps.

Dependencies cannot cross the normal and final phases. A final step does not make normal work optional.

Step revision protection adds to inherited mission protection. Direct agents in the step can revise that step subtree.

## Ordered queues

A queue is concise syntax for a strict sequence of ordinary steps.

```kdl
queue "investigations" {
  assigned-to "agent/${ST_MISSION_RUN}/steward"
  step "measure" { goal "Measure the current behavior." }
  step "improve" { goal "Implement and verify one improvement." }
  step "ship" { goal "Ship the verified improvement." }
}
```

The queue needs one or more steps. Queue steps keep flat mission step paths.

Each item after the first depends on its immediate predecessor being `completed`. Explicit additional dependencies remain valid.

A queue can set exactly one selector family. A step selector overrides the queue selector, and a queue selector overrides the mission selector.

The parsed mission and runtime views retain the queue ID and one-based position. Text and JSON views expose both values.

An ordinary mission body can contain multiple queues and ordinary steps. A nested mission can also contain a queue.

A queue cannot contain another queue or a `finally` block in this version. A `finally` block cannot contain a queue.

Queue order is definition state. Reordering items changes moved step hashes and uses the ordinary successor-generation compatibility rules.

## Goals

A goal is a concise, falsifiable statement about the result.

Use one `goal` node for one statement. Use up to three nodes when the mission or step has separate required outcomes.

Do not use source order or bullet syntax inside one string to create hidden execution structure. Steps and `depends-on` own execution structure.

## Mission constraints

A constraint states a rule that is specific to one mission or step.

A mission and a step can repeat `constraint`. An exact duplicate in one block is an error.

The effective order is each outer mission, its parent step, each nested mission, and the leaf step.

st3 shows the effective list when an agent shows or claims work.

Do not repeat universal st3 behavior as a mission constraint. The generated boot file defines that behavior.

Do not disable harness features to make an eval pass. A mission constraint must describe a real mission requirement.

## Mission inputs

A ready top-level mission can declare text and resource inputs.

```kdl
input "message" kind="text"
input "source" kind="resource"
```

A start request must provide exactly the declared names. Missing and extra names are errors.

Use `${input.message}` and `${input.source}` in execution content. st3 preserves quoted and multiline text when it writes interpolated KDL.

A resource input accepts `resource/NAME` or `resource/NAME@CLAIM_ID`.
st3 resolves a bare subject to its latest `resource.observed` claim atomically.

The run stores the exact resource subject and claim ID. Later claims do not change gates, inspection, or execution for that input.

Inputs do not support defaults, lists, secrets, schemas, or automatic environment export. Put an input in `env` when a process needs it.

Nested child missions cannot declare inputs in this version.

```sh
st3 publish mission.kdl --as person/operator
st3 mission start MISSION_ID \
  --input message="Review this release." \
  --input source=resource/release-source \
  --as person/operator

st3 claim resource/mission-inputs/source resource.observed \
  --field kind=custom.st3.document-source \
  --field state=ready
st3 eval ./evals/st3/mission-inputs \
  --input message="Input proof." \
  --input source=resource/mission-inputs/source
```

## Baselines

A baseline records state that must be true before new work starts.

```kdl
baseline "the incident is still open" {
  field "status" "resource/incident" "is" "open"
  lacks "doc/incident/decision@SHA256" "closed"
}
```

A baseline contains one or more graph predicates. Its predicates form an AND relation.

Baselines accept `exists`, `empty`, `field`, `has`, and `lacks`. They do not execute shell, LLM, human, or deadline work.

Mission baselines run before root work admission. st3 does not materialize a mission runtime before these baselines pass.

A false mission baseline puts the mission run in blocked state. st3 rechecks it after relevant graph changes while admission remains blocked.

Once normal work is admitted, the mission baseline is latched. st3 does not re-evaluate it as a continuous gate.

Step baselines run after dependencies hold and before each attempt becomes ready. A false step baseline blocks the step. It does not consume an attempt. A retry checks the baseline again.

A baseline is not historical storage by itself. The mission request or a prior claim must publish the measured state that the predicate names.

## Products

`produces` declares graph state that the work promises to create.

```kdl
produces {
  resource "mission-run/${ST_MISSION_RUN}/artifact" {
    kind "custom.st3.build-artifact"
    state "published"
  }
  message "mission-run/${ST_MISSION_RUN}/handoff" {
    status "read"
  }
}
```

Products can match `resource`, `message`, `agent`, `exec`, or `pty` subjects. Each product can require scalar fields.

All products in one block must hold.

A step product is intermediate output for that step. A mission product is a final contract for the complete normal phase.

The worker creates or observes products. st3 verifies them. The `produces` keyword does not perform the action.

A mission product can refer to output created during any step. Do not duplicate a step product at mission level unless the same graph subject is intentionally both an intermediate and final contract.

## Gates

A gate decides whether a completed work boundary can pass.

Missions and steps use repeated flat nodes:

```kdl
gate "the artifact exists" { exists "resource/build-artifact" }
gate "the report is green" { field "status" "resource/report" "is" "green" }
```

Sibling gates form an AND relation. There is no `gates` wrapper.

Step gates run after direct declarations, worker report, nested work, used mission, and products hold. Mission gates run after every normal step and all mission products hold.

Each running gate records `gate.requested` and `gate.result`. The result cites operation evidence. A pass releases the boundary. A failure fails the step or mission. A pending graph or human gate keeps the boundary pending.

### Predicate gates

```kdl
gate "subject exists" { exists "resource/result" }
gate "run has no live runtime" { empty "mission-run/${ST_MISSION_RUN}" }
gate "field matches" { field "status" "resource/result" "is" "green" }
gate "prefix matches" { field "revision" "resource/result" "starts-with" "git:" }
gate "text contains value" { has "doc/report@SHA256" "GREEN" }
gate "text omits value" { lacks "message/report" "UNVERIFIED" }
```

`field` uses this argument order: path, full subject, operator, value. Operators are `is`, `starts-with`, and `contains`.

`has` and `lacks` accept file, document, or message subjects.

A mission gate can also use `deadline "10m"`. A step uses its `timeout` property instead.

### Mechanical gates

```kdl
gate "the tests pass" {
  exec "cargo test --workspace"
  host "local"
  workspace "${ST_WORKSPACE}"
  env { RUST_BACKTRACE "1" }
  time-limit "10m"
}
```

A mechanical gate requires `exec`, `host`, and `workspace`. `env` is optional. `time-limit` defaults to two minutes.

The command runs through the supervised exec runtime. Its result is attempt-bound and durable.

### LLM gates

```kdl
gate "the migration preserves the public contract" type="llm" {
  model "gpt-5.6-sol"
  host "local"
  workspace "${ST_WORKSPACE}"
  tools "shell" "git"
  token-budget 12000
  time-limit "10m"
  prompt "Inspect the diff and evidence. Return PASS or FAIL with a reason."
}
```

An LLM gate requires an explicit model, host, workspace, tool list, positive token budget, time limit, and prompt.

Registered tools are `shell`, `git`, `gh`, and `network`.

The gate fails if its structured usage exceeds the declared token budget.

### Human gates

```kdl
gate "the release is approved" type="human" {
  reviewer "person/nathan"
  question "Is the release ready?"
  review "resource/release-candidate"
  review "doc/release/report@SHA256"
}
```

A human gate requires a full `person/...` reviewer. The question and repeated review targets are optional.

st3 creates one `gate.requested` claim for the exact mission or step revision and attempt. A review decision must match that request.

`st3 review ls` shows all pending KDL human gates. `st3 review ls --as person/NAME` selects one reviewer.

The human view shows the mission, owner step, question, review targets, age, and exact decision commands. `--json` returns the same current review records as structured data.

The list excludes resolved requests, old generations, changed definitions, old attempts, and terminal owners. A result from a different actor does not resolve a request.

## Dependencies

`depends-on` is the only step ordering language.

```kdl
depends-on {
  step "build" completed
  step "test" terminal
  field "status" "resource/change-window" "is" "open"
}
```

A step dependency can require `completed`, `failed`, or `terminal`. `completed` is the default when the state is omitted.

Graph predicate dependencies accept the same deterministic predicates as baselines. They latch after they pass. A later graph change does not move active work backward.

Dependencies inside a nested mission refer to sibling steps in that nested mission.

## Runtime sequence

Each run starts with all steps in pending state.

For a normal step, st3 performs this sequence:

1. Wait for the normal phase.
2. Wait for the parent nested step, when present.
3. Wait for every explicit dependency.
4. Evaluate all step baselines.
5. Resolve the nearest work selector.
6. Verify that at least one eligible agent is present, when the selector names agents.
7. Mark the attempt ready and increment its readiness epoch.
8. Materialize its direct declarations.
9. Wait for declaration convergence.
10. Wait for a worker report when an agent claimed the step.
11. Wait for nested mission steps or an exact used mission.
12. Verify products.
13. Evaluate gates.
14. Mark the step completed or failed.

When a step fails and its retry policy permits another attempt, st3 increments the attempt, applies backoff, and starts again at dependency and baseline admission. Retryable failure does not terminate the mission before the retry.

The `completion` frontier selects when st3 checks mission products and gates. st3 then enters the final phase when one exists.

The run reaches `completed` after successful final work. A final failure makes the run failed.

A mission without `completion` stays open. It is `standing` when no step can move and no failure blocks movement.

## Nested missions

A nested `mission` is part of its parent mission revision.

The parent step starts the nested roots after the parent is active. Nested steps inherit the nearest work selector unless a child overrides it.

Nested work remains durable graph state. It is not stored only in harness memory.

## Produced and used missions

A step can publish one complete ready mission as an attempt-bound output.

```kdl
step "compile-mission" {
  assigned-to "agent/planner"
  document "doc/project/mission@SHA256"
  produces-mission "project-work"
}
```

The worker must hold the producing step or one of its nested steps with the same assigned agent.

```sh
st3 work publish-mission step-run/GENERATION/compile-mission generated.kdl --as agent/planner
```

The published document must contain exactly one ready mission with the declared ID. st3 publishes the immutable revision and binds it to the producing definition and attempt.

A later step can start that exact output:

```kdl
step "execute-mission" {
  assigned-to "agent/planner"
  depends-on { step "compile-mission" completed }
  uses-mission output-of="compile-mission"
}
```

The output form requires an explicit completed dependency on the producer.

A step can also use an already published exact revision:

```kdl
uses-mission "project-work@REVISION_SHA256"
```

A used mission starts one linked child run. The wrapper completes only after the child completes. A failed or cancelled child fails the wrapper.

## Automatic context

st3 supplies these exact context names:

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `ST_MISSION` | Mission ID. |
| `ST_MISSION_REVISION` | Active mission revision hash. |
| `ST_MISSION_RUN` | Stable mission run ID without the `mission-run/` prefix. |
| `ST_RUN_GENERATION` | Current generation ID without the `run-generation/` prefix. |
| `ST_ROOT_MISSION_RUN` | Full root `mission-run/...` subject. |
| `ST_WORKSPACE` | Absolute run workspace. |
| `ST_REQUESTER` | Normalized requester subject. |
| `ST_STEP` | Step path in a step context. |
| `ST_STEP_RUN` | Full step-run subject in a step context. |
| `ST_ATTEMPT` | Current attempt number in a step context. |
| `ST_ASSIGNEE` | Fixed `assigned-to` agent, or an empty value for pools and agentless work. |
| `ST_PARENT_STEP_RUN` | Parent step-run subject, or an empty value. |
| `ST_GATE` | Gate name in a running gate context. |
| `ST3_SUBJECT` | Full subject of the current runtime member. |
| `ST_AGENT` | Full owning agent subject. It is absent for agentless runtimes. |
| `ST3_BIN` | Absolute path to the exact st3 executable that started the runtime. |

The mission and step values are available for `${NAME}` KDL interpolation when the current context defines them. Step members and running gates receive those values as environment variables.

`ST3_SUBJECT`, `ST_AGENT`, and `ST3_BIN` are runtime-only values because they depend on the materialized member.

For example, use `${ST_MISSION_RUN}` directly. Do not write a manual mapping such as `env { MISSION_RUN "${ST_MISSION_RUN}" }` only to rename the built-in value.

The exact built-in names are reserved in authored `env` maps. st3 rejects an attempt to replace them. Other names, including other `ST_*` names, remain available to applications.

`${PATH}` is also available for KDL interpolation. It uses the deterministic daemon service path.

An agent receives its own subject in both `ST3_SUBJECT` and `ST_AGENT`. A nested task receives its task subject in `ST3_SUBJECT` and its parent agent in `ST_AGENT`.

An agentless `exec` or `pty` receives `ST3_SUBJECT` and no `ST_AGENT`.

An unknown variable or a variable that is not available in the current phase is an error.

## Agent boot contract

An agent harness prompt is optional.

st3 appends this exact text once to every agent launch:

```text
Read @.st3/boot.md completely. Then list and claim your current st3 work.
```

The shared render transaction writes the canonical `.st3/boot.md` before a native harness starts.

The file explains graph work, Small Talk, wait behavior, and diagnostics. It does not contain a mission goal.

An authored prompt can add stable harness context. It cannot replace or duplicate the boot contract.

A tracked file at `.st3/boot.md` causes the complete render transaction to fail before any runtime starts.

## Workspace existence

st3 requires every member workspace to exist before the member starts.

Use an explicit create property when the mission owns creation of that directory:

```kdl
workspace "${ST_WORKSPACE}/generated" create=#true
```

The default refusal prevents a spelling error from creating an unintended directory.

## Message delivery for generic harnesses

A harness driver can implement native message delivery. A generic terminal harness can use an explicit DING child:

```kdl
agent "worker" {
  workspace "${ST_WORKSPACE}/worker"
  command "worker-harness"
  exec "ding" {
    argv "st3" "driver" "ding"
    restart "on-failure"
  }
}
```

The nested exec receives the agent subject through `ST_AGENT`. It checks the local st3 API once per second and sends an incarnation-fenced terminal line.

The mission run owns and cleans up both runtimes. No implicit `ding` field exists in st3 KDL.

A provider or runtime fault creates a `harness.diagnostic` claim. The roster and mission views show the fault.

The runtime can also send one fault message for a new diagnostic epoch. st3 does not require a special supervisor, root, or chief-of-staff agent.

## Agent grouping

`under` is repeatable agent metadata.

```kdl
agent "researcher" {
  under "lead" reason="the lead combines the research"
  under "design-group"
  workspace "/work/research"
  command "research"
}
```

A bare target inside a mission uses the same mission run. A full external agent subject stays full.

The relation is visible in `st3 agents --json`, status, and assigned work. It is suitable for a tree or graph UI.

The relation does not create permission, lifecycle, scheduling, or mandatory reporting behavior.

Missing targets, self-relations, and cycles create warnings during preview. They do not block publication or another agent.

## Host documents

A root host declaration can repeat exact document references:

```kdl
host "local" {
  document "doc/hosts/local@SHA256"
}
```

The host document gives stable host facts to agents on that host. It must not contain current work.

st3 renders each exact document under `.st3/host/` for every native harness on that host.

The generated `.st3/boot.md` lists each exact reference and rendered path. A missing document, invalid text, or path collision refuses the render transaction.

Publication fails with `missing-document` until the exact document bytes exist in the local store.

A bare document name is invalid in a host declaration. A later version needs a new hash and a new declaration.

## Work selection

A mission or step can declare one agent selector kind. Only a step can declare `agentless`.

```kdl
assigned-to "agent/${ST_MISSION_RUN}/only-worker"
```

`assigned-to` means that only the named agent can claim the work.

```kdl
available-to "agent/${ST_MISSION_RUN}/worker-a"
available-to "agent/${ST_MISSION_RUN}/worker-b"
```

`available-to` creates an explicit pool. The first eligible claim wins one step atomically.

The same agent can claim multiple ready steps. A pool does not impose a one-step limit.

```kdl
agentless
```

`agentless` means that the reconciler performs the work without an agent claim. Subgraphs and gates can complete an agentless step.

A local selector replaces the inherited selector. It does not add to it.

The inheritance order is the step, its mission, its parent step, and its parent mission. The nearest selector wins.

A step without an explicit or inherited selector is agentless.

A duplicate pool member is invalid. Combining selector kinds in one mission or step is invalid.

A missing eligible agent creates a preview warning. A step blocks only when none of its eligible agents exist in desired state.

## Work commands

Claimed work uses a renewable claim bound to the agent identity and runtime incarnation.

A nested work action renews active ancestor leases held by the same agent incarnation.

```sh
st3 work ls --as agent/RUN/node.worker
st3 work show step-run/GENERATION/step
st3 work claim step-run/GENERATION/step --as agent/RUN/node.worker
st3 work progress step-run/GENERATION/step --summary "The tests are running."
st3 work complete step-run/GENERATION/step --summary "The product is published."
st3 work fail step-run/GENERATION/step --reason "The compiler rejected the source."
st3 work release step-run/GENERATION/step --reason "The work needs another owner."
```

The default work list shows ready, active, and blocked work. It summarizes waiting and terminal work.

Add `--all` to show waiting and terminal work. Add `--json` to keep the stable machine view for the selected set.

The default `work show` and `work claim` output gives a human-readable step view. It keeps every actionable subject exact.

A worker completion report is not a correctness result. Products and gates still control final completion.

The native driver renews active claims. It delivers one Small Talk message for each readiness epoch and harness incarnation.

A pool message closes when another agent wins the claim. Release or expiry creates a new readiness epoch and a new message.

The work queue is authoritative. A notification only tells an agent that the queue might contain new work.

The reconciler does not send periodic reminders. A future harness-stall policy can create a new explicit epoch after a measured timeout.

The MVP does not implement that harness-stall timeout.

## Standing runs and cancellation

All mission runs use the same state machine. There is no separate standing mission type.

An open mission becomes `standing` when it has no next step and has no explicit completion result.

An open mission still asserts its direct declarations. This rule lets a standing conversation mission keep its agent present.

`st3 codex` and `st3 claude` publish a deterministic zero-step standing mission. The first command for an agent starts one run.

An exact retry returns the same run. A later configuration change creates a new generation in that run.

The quick command returns the mission, mission run, run generation, and agent subjects.

A mission run does not stop because a controller deletes its runtime. The graph must publish cancellation.

```kdl
version 2
mission-run "RUN_ID" {
  cancellation "request-withdrawn" {
    reason "The request was withdrawn."
  }
}
```

Cancellation revokes active claims and cancels normal work. It then runs the adjacent `finally` graph.

A terminal normal step failure does the same when the mission has an explicit completion rule.

Cancellation also cancels active descendant mission runs. Each descendant uses its own final phase.

The terminal state is `cancelled` after successful final work. A final failure makes the run failed.

After final work, st3 enters cleanup and stops every runtime owned by the mission run.

The run becomes terminal only after those runtime subjects report a stopped, absent, or exited state.

An exact repeated cancellation is idempotent. The old run and its immutable generations remain readable.

st3 sends a cancellation message to each active claimant. The message tells the agent to stop that step.

## Continuous missions

A continuous mission stays open after its current steps are exhausted. It does not need a separate mission type.

A recurring schedule creates a durable request for one exact finite mission revision.

```kdl
schedule "cycle" {
  host "local"
  every "6h"
  anchor "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  catch-up "latest"
  work {
    mission "fabric/cycle@REVISION"
    workspace "/work/fabric-cycles"
  }
}
```

The runtime gives each occurrence a deterministic mission run and a unique workspace below the declared root.

The mission steps are normal claimable work. A schedule does not start another occurrence while its prior mission run remains active.

Each finite cycle can be a nested mission. The parent mission keeps the stable agent and the cycle history.

Use `catch-up "latest"` when a restart must create at most one missed wake occurrence.

The schedule does not assign work. The referenced mission defines its work selectors.

## Mission revisions

Revision authority comes from agent placement in the current generation.

- A direct agent in a step can revise that step subtree.
- A direct agent in a mission can revise the complete mission.
- A direct agent adjacent to missions can revise those missions.

The run requester can propose any revision. A work selector does not grant revision authority.

An agent also needs explicit mission operation authority in its current desired declaration:

```kdl
agent "planner" {
  workspace "${ST_WORKSPACE}"
  harness "codex" {}
  mission-authority {
    publish "project/generated"
    start "fleet/fabric/*"
    revise "fleet/fabric/*"
  }
}
```

Each rule accepts an exact mission ID or a terminal `/*` namespace. The value omits the `mission/` subject prefix.

No agent receives mission authority by default. `publish`, `start`, and `revise` are separate permissions.

Mission publication requires a claimed step with the exact `produces-mission` declaration. The agent must use `st3 work publish-mission`.

Mission start requires `start` authority. Mission revision requires both `revise` authority and existing structural revision authority.

The daemon reads authority from the current desired agent. A candidate mission cannot grant authority to its publisher.

Persons and internal system actions keep their existing authority. System starts from `uses-mission`, schedules, and subscriptions are unchanged.

This check protects a trusted local runtime. Caller identity is not cryptographically authenticated, so `--as` remains a trusted-operator boundary.

st3 checks the current generation. A candidate cannot add itself as an owner and use that new authority.

`revisions="human-only"` protects a mission or step. The protection is inherited by nested steps.

`revision-reviewer="person/NAME"` selects the human reviewer. The run requester is the reviewer when this property is absent.

All distinct reviewers for the changed paths must approve. Each approval names the exact proposal preview hash.

```sh
st3 work revise MISSION_RUN replacement.kdl \
  --as agent/RUN/worker \
  --reason "The generated source adds one verification step."

st3 work revision show MISSION_RUN
st3 work revision approve PROPOSAL PREVIEW_HASH --as person/reviewer
st3 work revision cancel PROPOSAL --as person/reviewer --reason "The request changed."
```

A run can have one pending proposal. A second proposal fails until the first proposal is applied or cancelled.

### Deferred declarative revision intent

A future KDL operation can propose a produced mission revision against one live mission run.

The operation should compile into the existing revision proposal claims. It must not create a second revision or generation model.

Publishing a mission revision alone must not move an active run. The declaration must identify the target run and exact revision.

A parent mission could target a linked child run. This would let a controller publish the parent mission from a shell heredoc.

The mission could then sequence the proposal and verify the successor generation with normal dependencies and gates.

A human-only approval must remain an external authorized claim. Publishing the controlling KDL must not imply that approval.

This direction is deferred. The first design must define target selection, authority, idempotency, cancellation, and failure behavior.

### Immutable generations

Each accepted revision creates one immutable successor generation. The stable mission-run subject points to the current generation.

The cutover transaction creates generation-specific step-run subjects. It also marks the old generation as superseded.

```sh
st3 work revision generations MISSION_RUN
st3 work revision generation RUN_GENERATION
```

st3 compares normalized step definition hashes. A changed step and every transitive dependent start without prior completion.

Every compatible state carries to the successor. Compatible claimed, working, or verifying work restarts in ready state.

The old generation remains readable. A late work action against it fails with `stale-run-generation`.

Mission and step members record their owner run and generation. The reconciler stops members left only in the superseded generation lineage.

A compatible member keeps the same run-local subject in the successor. A mission revision cannot move it to another mission run.

A cutover cancels active descendant mission runs that started from predecessor steps. `when-idle` also waits for claimed, working, or verifying descendant work before cutover.

The default `restart-active` cutover creates the successor after approval. Open work messages for the old generation close as superseded.

`revision-cutover="when-idle"` changes the run phase to `revision-draining`. Existing active work can settle, but no new work can claim.

The reconciler creates the successor after the active work reaches a stable state. Cancellation returns the run to its normal phase.

The run keeps its initial revision and root revision. Its current revision is the revision of its current generation.

## Immutable documents

`document` on a step always requires `doc/NAME@SHA256`.

```sh
st3 doc put request.md --as doc/project/request
st3 doc get doc/project/request@SHA256 --output request.md
st3 doc list doc/project/request
```

Bare document names can appear in an intent before preview. The preview resolves them to the current exact hash. Apply validates the bytes and binds that exact version.

Do not store credentials or raw private measurements in Git or shared st3 documents.

Store a summary, a redacted sample, or a hash when later work needs durable evidence. Keep raw private data in a restricted external store.

## Preview, publish, and start

`st3 preview FILE` validates KDL, resolves documents, displays changes, returns subject tokens, and performs no write.

`st3 publish FILE --as ACTOR` repeats preview and applies the exact tokens. It never starts a mission run.

`st3 mission start MISSION --as ACTOR` publishes one mission-run declaration for the current ready revision. Add `--follow` to follow the run until it becomes terminal or standing.

`st3 mission show MISSION_RUN` reads one exact run. `st3 mission show MISSION` works only when that mission has exactly one nonterminal run.

The default mission view shows the complete run summary and its active graph branch. Add `--follow` to watch an existing run.

Follow mode redraws one screen on a terminal. It appends each changed snapshot when another program reads the output.

Add `--json` to any mission or work view when a program needs the stable data shape.

The mission shortcut fails when it finds zero or multiple active runs. The error tells the caller to use an exact mission-run subject.

## Planning mode

Planning mode asks one durable Codex harness to author Markdown and KDL for review.

```sh
st3 planning start --id release-mission request.md \
  --workspace ./project \
  --as person/nathan \
  --model gpt-5.6-sol \
  --effort medium

st3 planning show SESSION
st3 planning preview SESSION
st3 planning revise SESSION feedback.md --as person/nathan
st3 planning approve SESSION PREVIEW_HASH --as person/nathan
st3 planning cancel SESSION --as person/nathan --reason "The request changed."
```

Planning can also prepare a revision for one current mission run:

```sh
st3 planning start --run MISSION_RUN request.md \
  --workspace ./project \
  --as person/nathan

st3 planning preview SESSION --variant compact
st3 planning preview SESSION --variant extended
st3 planning compare SESSION compact extended
st3 planning propose SESSION extended \
  --as person/nathan \
  --reason "The extended variant covers the discovered risk."
```

The planner uses this command:

```sh
st3 planning submit SESSION --variant compact --markdown MISSION.md --kdl mission.kdl
```

The session stores the request, feedback, Markdown, and KDL as immutable documents. Small Talk carries document references, not mutable file paths.

Each named candidate must contain exactly one ready mission with the requested ID.

A run-targeted session stores the exact source generation and an immutable run context document.

The session can hold multiple draft variants. Proposing one variant rejects a stale source generation.

Preview returns these review values:

- the candidate and mission revisions;
- a static dependency graph;
- the graph subject diff;
- warnings and blockers;
- exact subject tokens;
- one hash over the complete preview.

Revision invalidates the prior preview. Approval requires the current preview hash and current subject tokens.

Approval publishes the ready mission and one `planning-session.approved` claim. It does not start a run. Approval and cancellation stop the planner.

Controllers should wait on `planning-session.*` events. They must not spend an agent turn to poll session status.

## Public gate result

A running mechanical or LLM gate gets a one-use operation capability. Its runner records the terminal result with:

```sh
st3 gate-result pass \
  --operation-capability OPERATION_CAPABILITY \
  --reason "The checks passed." \
  --evidence claim/EVIDENCE
```

The API endpoint is `POST /v1/gate-results`. The durable kinds are `gate.requested` and `gate.result`.

## Claims and evidence

Mission execution uses these important claim kinds:

- `mission.published` records an immutable mission revision.
- `planning-session.approved` links an approved planning session to Markdown and KDL.
- `mission-run.created` and `mission-run.state` record stable run history.
- `run-generation.created`, `run-generation.superseded`, and `run-generation.state` record revision lineage.
- `revision-proposal.created`, `revision-proposal.approved`, `revision-proposal.cancelled`, and `revision-proposal.applied` record revision review.
- `step-run.carried`, `step-run.state`, and `step-run.retried` record generation-specific step history.
- `mission.produced` binds a generated mission to one producing attempt.
- `gate.requested` and `gate.result` record gate operations and evidence.
- `gate.requested` and `gate.result` record exact human gates.

Evidence is a list of claim IDs or immutable graph references that support a result. The evidence does not replace the gate. The gate definition says what must be decided; evidence records why the result is trustworthy.

## Eval contract

`st3 eval DIRECTORY` archives the explicit directory, posts staged documents, applies its version 2 intent, and starts the selected eval mission.

New top-level eval fixtures belong to the eval run and leave the selected graph during cleanup. An eval can reuse an identical selected declaration. It cannot replace a different selected declaration, such as production host metadata.

The planning-mode eval uses one real Codex planner. A controller waits on the event stream and directly approves the first valid candidate. Mechanical gates prove that the mission was hidden before approval, the preview graph and diff were rendered, the exact hash was approved, one ready mission was published, no run started, immutable documents were linked, the planner stopped, and the workspace did not change.

The planning variant and stale-generation paths are deterministic API tests. They do not spend a model run.

The run-generation revision eval proves an approved cutover, lineage, state carry-over, and automatic generation context. It uses no model run.
