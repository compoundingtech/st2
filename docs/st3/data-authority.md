# st3 data authority

This document classifies each SQLite table in schema version 12.

Schema version 12 upgrades schema versions 10 and 11 in place.

The claim log and immutable blobs are the durable graph authority.

All other tables are indexes, projections, local capabilities, or transport recovery state.

| Table | Class | Rebuild or recovery source |
|---|---|---|
| `meta` | Local store metadata | Store initialization and configured node identity |
| `batches` | Claim-log authority | Accepted local and replicated batch headers |
| `claims` | Claim-log authority | Accepted local and replicated claims |
| `blobs` | Content authority | Posted bytes, verified by SHA-256 |
| `operations` | Projection | Claim `_operation` metadata |
| `documents` | Projection | `doc.bound` claims and blobs |
| `desired` | Projection | Selected `intent.desired` heads |
| `events` | Projection | Effective accepted claims |
| `mission_revisions` | Projection | `mission.published` claims |
| `mission_definitions` | Projection | Selected `mission.published` heads |
| `mission_runs` | Projection | `mission-run.*` claims |
| `run_generations` | Projection | `run-generation.*` claims |
| `step_runs` | Projection | `step-run.*` and `work.*` claims |
| `revision_proposals` | Projection | `revision-proposal.*` claims |
| `planning_sessions` | Projection | `planning-session.*` claims |
| `planning_candidates` | Projection | `planning-session.candidate-submitted` claims |
| `planning_previews` | Projection | `planning-session.previewed` claims |
| `idempotency` | Opaque response cache | Hashed caller keys and derived responses |
| `mission_run_requests` | Opaque validation cache | Hashed caller keys and request digests |
| `capabilities` | Local short-lived authority | Dedicated API issuance; capabilities do not replicate |
| `replica_envelopes` | Replicated authority | Authenticated outer envelopes and their exact payloads |
| `replica_records` | Admission state | Envelope records, validation results, and repair references |
| `projection_health` | Local diagnostic projection | Projection attempts against admitted authority |
| `replication_peers` | Local transport state | Last signed exchange or transport failure for each configured peer |
| `peer_cursors` | Legacy test state | The removed cursor protocol; production does not use this table |
| `peer_replica_cursors` | Legacy test state | The removed cursor protocol; production does not use this table |

The store rebuilds operation and planning projections when it opens.

Replication receipt stores an envelope before admission decodes its payload.

Admission validates each claim and blob independently. Invalid or unknown records do not enter graph projections.

Projection uses admitted claims and keeps the last good graph when one reduction fails.

`st3 doctor` compares the operation projection with the claim log.

An idempotent claim stores a keyed hash of the caller key in its `_operation` metadata.

`st3 claim --idempotency-key KEY` opts a public claim into this contract.

The claim stores the canonical request digest and canonical claim ID.

An exact retry returns the original claim.

A retry with different input returns `idempotency-mismatch`.

Conflicting replicated operations mark the affected graph subject as indeterminate.

A `record.repaired` claim names one bad record and one valid replacement claim.

Repair keeps the original record. It changes the record state to `repaired` and records the replacement reference.

The database does not store the caller key.

Eval cleanup removes every desired projection row owned by the terminal eval run.

Eval history stays in the immutable claim log.

A cleanup residue produces `eval.verdict` with `verdict=fail`.

A cleanup infrastructure error produces `eval.verdict` with `verdict=void`.
