# st2 requirements

## Context

st2 implements the executable agent contract in
[`compoundingtech/evals/AGENT-SPEC.md`](https://github.com/compoundingtech/evals/blob/main/AGENT-SPEC.md).
The vision is defined in [vision.md](./vision.md). These requirements are the
current ratified product floor, not the entire future scheduler roadmap; new
scheduling and workflow constraints belong here only after their behavior is
accepted.

## Assumptions

- **A01 Declared fleet:** Each runnable agent has one current authored
  declaration and one pinned host.
- **A02 Trusted private fleet:** The catalog, runtime state, and participating
  hosts belong to one trusted operator; st2 is not an adversarial multi-tenant
  boundary.
- **A03 Durable host state:** Each host preserves its catalog and runtime state
  across process restarts. Whole-disk loss and backup are outside st2.
- **A04 Eventual transport:** Hosts may disconnect; Fabric eventually resumes
  transport when connectivity returns. st2 does not guarantee network
  availability.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs

- **T01 Explicit limits:** A documented unsupported case is preferable to a
  hidden distributed guarantee.

## Requirements

### Must implement the agent contract

- **R01 Agent-spec compliance:** st2 validates and implements every agent-spec
  capability it claims to support, and identifies unsupported capabilities.
- **R02 Canonical KDL and declaration identity:** Hand-authored KDL is the
  canonical declaration; any generator is optional and its output is
  inspectable before reconciliation. Declarations are discovered recursively.
  An explicit `identity` and `host` pair is authoritative independent of its
  folder path, while either omitted field retains path-derived defaults and
  mismatch diagnostics. The declaration's parent remains its state/resource
  anchor. Dot-prefixed and other organizational folders have no implicit
  lifecycle meaning; discovery excludes `.git` and `.st2` control directories
  at any depth, the catalog-root `pty` runtime directory, and state namespaces
  directly owned by a declaration.
- **R03 Host-pinned placement:** Every runnable agent or task resolves to its
  declared host; host-local roots own reconciliation.

### Must provide intelligent host supervision

- **R04 Root supervision:** Every machine has exactly one root agent. The
  deterministic st2 reconciler keeps declared local processes converged; the
  root observes host-local runtime health, diagnoses failures, performs bounded
  recovery, and escalates what it cannot resolve.
- **R22 Quiet coordination after events:** A network with minimal or default
  personas stays quiet while useful work continues. Agents coordinate only after
  an inbox DING, a durable failure, a real blocker, a completion or decision
  handoff, or a declared schedule with a name. They continue until they resolve
  the need or hand it off. Repeated status messages and peer polling are not
  substitutes. Normal supervisors handle failures and blocked work. They do not
  continuously manage healthy work. A custom supervisor persona can require
  more frequent coordination. CoS is only an example. st2 does not define or
  require that role, and it gives the role no standard authority. Transport
  loss does not stop independent host-local work.

### Must preserve delivery and launch behavior

- **R05 DING/archive semantics:** Inbox delivery, archive precedence, retries,
  suppression, and restart recovery are deterministic and tested. DING may
  interrupt agent work, but it must not alter or submit a human's active draft;
  an unknown interaction state defers delivery.
- **R06 Restartable launch definitions:** A restarted PTY or exec receives the
  complete effective launch definition, including environment and supported
  launch fields.
- **R07 Verified hooks:** Required hook content is installed explicitly and
  verified before a rendered agent depends on it. The selected receipt carries
  the binary's real source identity regardless of build system. Ordered
  upgrades are automatic; selecting an older, unorderable, or unreadable exact
  hook set requires explicit replacement authority. A selection change does not
  invalidate another running binary's previously installed immutable set. Hook
  interpreters and runtime dependencies are portable and explicit on every
  supported package environment.
- **R11 Control-plane replacement safety:** Stopping or killing `st2 up` must
  not stop, restart, or replace any agent it launched. st2 can be reinstalled
  and restarted while running agents continue unchanged; the replacement
  control plane adopts those existing processes by stable identity and starts
  only genuinely missing work. Stopping an agent is a separate, explicit
  lifecycle action.

### Must externalize agent state and scope

- **R08 Catalog observability:** Catalog-backed state exposes each agent's
  presence, declared activity status, current plan, and current plan step
  without PTY or transcript inspection. Presence and activity status are
  distinct, and stale state is identifiable.
- **R09 State continuity:** An agent's current work and durable decisions
  can survive process replacement without depending on its transcript.
- **R10 Agent-only identity:** st2 models agents. Non-agent identities are
  unsupported.

- **R13 Shortest-path reconciliation:** An event is evidence, not permission
  to run the world. st2 classifies source, path, kind, and affected identity,
  then takes the shortest correct path from observed state to desired state.
- **R14 Explicit filesystem-event contracts:** Every watcher is deny-by-default
  with exact roots, paths, mutation kinds, semantic meaning, debounce policy,
  and consumer. Reads, opens, unknown paths, and runtime output never trigger
  generic reconciliation.
- **R15 Bounded event coalescing:** Accepted event streams use tested
  head/tail coalescing: immediate head response, one quiet tail, and a hard
  maximum preventing starvation or unbounded scans, PTY queries, launches,
  delivery attempts, or writes.

- **R16 Supervisor declaration:** Every non-root agent declares exactly one
  supervisor; root is the only agent without a supervisor.
- **R17 Durable error propagation:** Lifecycle, harness/eval, provider-turn,
  task/exec/PTY, hook, and delivery errors are durably reported to the
  responsible supervisor with agent/task identity and actionable context.
- **R19 Targeted reconciliation:** An exact agent/task selector resolves its
  identity and pinned host before mutation; unknown, ambiguous, and wrong-host
  targets refuse before writes, listing, or actions. Materialization, hook
  gates, PTY inspection, and plan execution are limited to the selected
  owner/task; unrelated diagnostics remain visible while unrelated workspaces,
  tasks, and live PTY PID/generation stay unchanged.
  Stable IDs alone select and authorize automation; presentation values never
  resolve a message, Resource, status, lifecycle, or authoring target.
- **R20 Portable Resource bindings:** An agent may directly carry zero or more
  order-independent Resource bindings. Each binding has a non-empty, agent-local
  unique name and preserves a non-empty, opaque type discriminator and an RFC
  3986 absolute URI byte-for-byte without normalization. The generic envelope
  does not imply resolution, access, readiness, or lifecycle semantics;
  declarations that add such unsupported policy are rejected rather than
  silently ignored.
- **R21 Nondisruptive Resource observation:** Machine-readable catalog
  inspection exposes every Resource binding without interpreting its type or URI.
  Resource-only declaration changes do not alter a task's effective launch
  definition and do not stop, replace, or relaunch healthy work.
- **R27 Transactional catalog authoring:** One st2 publication operation admits
  exactly one canonical KDL Agent Spec, with explicit host and identity, against
  the complete prospective catalog. Publication is compare-and-swap, durable,
  and atomic: readers observe either the previous declaration set or the next
  complete set. Reconciliation holds one coherent declaration snapshot through
  materialization, runtime observation, planning, and execution, so a retirement
  cannot commit and then be followed by a launch from stale catalog input.
  A durable incomplete-apply marker fences every declaration-plane snapshot and
  action after a crashed whole-catalog apply; a resident supervisor stays alive
  but performs zero lifecycle actions until the transaction is completed.
  Every successful declaration commit advances a durable monotonic catalog
  generation; whole-catalog apply advances it before its marker clears. Unlocked
  diagnostic readers therefore detect even a completed declaration ABA across
  their observation. A durable incomplete-generation intent fences readers
  across each single-writer commit and is conservatively recovered by the next
  exclusive writer. Existing-catalog writer staging exists only in the reserved
  control plane, never among authoritative declaration leaves; fresh bootstrap
  stages one non-authoritative sibling because its control plane does not exist
  yet.
  Presence, messages, context, and Resource state remain independently writable
  and are never serialized behind catalog authoring.
  A caller binds single-agent publication to the exact no-follow source capture
  with an authoritative input digest. A canonical whole-catalog snapshot
  externalizes the declaration-root digest while excluding runtime state and
  workspace content. Its closed projection includes every regular file in a
  bounded `_templates` library and exact declared canonical workspace directory
  facts. Whole-catalog apply accepts only that projection, rechecks the root
  digest under the exclusive lock, durably stages the desired bytes, and resumes
  after interruption solely from a closed marker and its content-addressed
  stage. Version 1 requires one explicit external PTY root and rejects effective
  PTY-root changes. Fresh-catalog bootstrap is a distinct create transaction,
  not a catalog-apply mode: it binds an exact captured prepared projection to a
  caller-supplied digest, initializes the persistent authoring lock and first
  catalog generation before visibility, and publishes the complete catalog by
  one durable no-replace directory rename. A retry is unchanged only when the
  completed existing catalog has the exact prepared declaration root. Bootstrap
  validates and preserves one explicit external PTY root but performs no PTY
  registry I/O; process adoption and PTY-root migration remain outside its
  atomic boundary because the registry has independent producers. Apply never
  traverses, hashes, deletes, or relocates workspace or runtime state. An absent
  canonical identity becomes
  visible only as a complete bundle; a preexisting declared workspace skeleton
  remains safe because the durable marker fences declaration readers and
  marker-time state routing throughout leaf publication and verification.
  A policy-free prepared-catalog comparison takes the existing shared lock,
  binds the live side to a caller-supplied declaration-root digest, captures the
  prepared side through retained no-follow capabilities, and fully admits both
  projections before returning one versioned receipt. The receipt exposes the
  before/after declaration roots, exact added/removed/modified projected paths
  with render/template/static classification, and normalized per-agent
  Agent Spec-model field-address changes. Addresses expose only the structural
  and dynamic address keys needed to locate a field; payload values and
  per-value/agent hashes remain private. Omission and explicit defaults are
  equivalent. Comparison never
  writes live declarations, generation/marker state, runtime/state/workspace
  bytes, or the prepared source, and carries no migration policy or publication
  authority.
- **R23 Fail-closed task inventory:** One read-only machine command exposes
  every desired local PTY and exec task by agent identity, task name, runtime
  id, kind, lifecycle, retirement, desired state, runtime state, PID, creation
  time, and opaque runtime-generation id. Unknown, duplicate, malformed,
  unreadable, timed-out, PID-reused, or otherwise unprovable evidence is
  indeterminate and makes the versioned envelope incomplete and the command
  unsuccessful; it is never reported as absence. Observation detects semantic
  declaration drift across its runtime probe, does not invoke a backend for a
  root positively absent at admission, and performs no reconciliation, cleanup,
  lifecycle change, or state rewrite. An admitted PTY root that changes
  filesystem identity during the backend probe makes the observation
  incomplete; the external backend may already have recreated a concurrently
  removed registry. This diagnostic boundary is not transactionally serialized
  with catalog or runtime writers and is not control-plane cutover authority.
  It samples the durable catalog generation and incomplete marker around
  discovery and runtime observation; any marker, malformed fence, or generation
  change makes the envelope incomplete.
- **R24 Stable identity and bounded presentation:** The positional Agent Spec
  identity and its host-qualified bus identity remain the sole stable keys for
  routing, ownership, adoption, lifecycle, and automation. Agent Specs may
  declare optional, non-empty `name` and `description` strings in canonical KDL
  and the readable TOML/JSON forms. `name` is a non-unique mutable human label,
  limited to 160 Unicode scalars; `description` is an enduring responsibility
  boundary, limited to 1,000. Both are single-line: Cc control characters and
  U+2028/U+2029 are invalid. Omission means absence. Presentation is never an
  alias, and the declaration is its sole source of truth; a sibling `name` file
  is ignored without migration or compatibility behavior.
- **R25 Constrained presentation authoring:** `st2 rename` and `st2 describe`
  set or clear only their corresponding direct field in one canonical KDL
  declaration selected by stable identity. They preserve unrelated source
  bytes, serialize cooperating local writers through the persistent shared
  `.st2/catalog-authoring.lock`, reject a stale source before atomic
  replacement, fsync the result, and return classified receipts. The lock inode
  is never removed or stale-recovered and defines one local POSIX
  filesystem/kernel exclusion domain; it is not cross-host coordination or OS
  isolation from direct external writers. TOML, JSON, declarations explicitly
  marked Nix-owned, stable-ID changes, and malformed or ambiguous targets fail
  closed. Nix emitters must publish that marker before authoring is activated.
  In the trusted-fleet model, caller-supplied `ST_AGENT` provides a guardrail,
  not authentication: a catalog agent may edit itself or a descendant reached
  through declared supervisor edges, while its absence selects the operator
  path.
- **R26 Nondisruptive presentation projection:** For every active host-local
  catalog Agent Spec, st2 publishes one versioned machine-readable presentation
  snapshot at the fixed declaration-local state path
  `resources/presentation.json`. The snapshot contains stable host and identity
  plus optional name and description derived solely from the current Agent
  Spec. Publication is deterministic, atomic, durable, and idempotent. The
  snapshot contains no provider, account, session, or lifecycle data; it is
  intrinsic st2 state, not a Resource binding, and has no routing, selection,
  authorization, launch, adoption, restart, teardown, replacement, or other
  lifecycle authority. For every healthy managed PTY, st2 also reconciles a
  versioned owned tag snapshot containing the stable actor identity plus
  optional description through one exact task-ID metadata patch. The primary
  `agent` task additionally maps optional name to native PTY display metadata;
  secondary PTYs preserve their task-specific display convention. Projection
  preserves unrelated tags, removes absent owned values, reports and retries
  failure, and is idempotent. It never uses display-name resolution or enters
  launch, teardown, garbage collection, replacement, or flapping accounting.
- **R27 Typed agent desired state:** Every admitted Agent Spec has exactly one
  whole-agent desired state: `running`, `suspended`, or `retired`. Omission and
  legacy `retired #false` mean running; legacy `retired #true` means retired
  without a rationale. New suspended and retired declarations require one
  valid human rationale of 1..160 UTF-8 bytes. Running forbids a rationale, and
  a declaration that mixes legacy `retired` with `desired-state` is invalid.
  Running uses ordinary task reconciliation. Suspended and retired agents do
  not launch or materialize tasks and tear down every live owned task,
  including generated companions. Suspension preserves the declaration,
  inbox, context, resources, and existing `keep` and `adopt-only` policy; resume
  grants no replacement authority beyond ordinary reconciliation. Retirement
  retains its stronger collection contract.
- **R28 Desired-state authoring and observation:** `st2 agent desired-state`
  changes lifecycle intent only in one canonical KDL declaration selected by
  stable identity. It uses the same source-preserving, durable, serialized,
  exact-target, trusted-fleet authority boundary as presentation authoring and
  refuses Nix-owned, malformed, ambiguous, or unsupported declarations.
  Running is canonically omitted; suspended and retired states persist their
  rationale. Its receipt proves the declaration edit, never runtime
  convergence. Human listing, roster JSON, task inventory, and Doctor expose
  desired state without conflating it with presence or observed liveness.
