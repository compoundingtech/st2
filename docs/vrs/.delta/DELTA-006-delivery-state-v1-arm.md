# DELTA-006: the pre-ledger `delivery-state.json` boundary arm outlives its own necessity

Status: open

## Divergence

The canonical delivery ledger owns exactly one schema, `st2.delivery-ledger.v1`,
and `src/delivery_ledger.rs` is written as though only that format had ever
shipped. It nevertheless carries one statement that knows otherwise: the
`ErrorKind::NotFound` arm of `Ledger::open` calls
`crate::migrations::delivery_state::recover`, which reads the single-binding
`delivery-state.json` record every pre-ledger release wrote and carries an
in-flight attempt forward as an assertion instead of letting it be re-sent.

That arm is correct today and is dead weight the moment no such record exists
anywhere. Nothing in the code can observe that condition, so the divergence is
between an implementation that must still translate a retired format and a
design that owns one format — and it closes by deletion, on a fleet
observation, not by an amendment.

## VRS

No ratified requirement mentions either record. The rule the arm exists to
preserve is [`DING-R07`](../01-ding/requirements.md) staged ownership: once an
attempt has started, ambiguity about whether it landed is resolved by
inspection, never by pasting the same notice again. A release boundary is
exactly such an ambiguity — the old binary's record is the only evidence that
an attempt was made — so dropping that record on upgrade would resolve the
ambiguity by re-sending, which DING-R07 forbids and DING-T01 answers the other
way: every ambiguous case resolves toward deferral.

Requirements therefore need no change. What needs recording is that a piece of
the implementation is deliberately temporary, with the observation that ends
it.

## Implementation

`src/migrations/delivery_state/` owns the whole boundary: `mod.rs` (the entry
point, the ownership filter, the legacy filename), `codex_v1.rs`, and
`opencode_v1.rs` (one retired wire struct each, plus the meaning of its
labels — Codex's `accepted` was a typed in-turn receipt and grades to
`consumed`, OpenCode's was a storage read-back and grades to `persisted`).

Canonical code gains one version-free concept, `Attestation{Observed,
Asserted}` on `Entry`: a phase this build graded versus a phase another
authority asserted. An assertion bounds what already happened, so it suppresses
a duplicate; it is not an observation, so it authorizes no transport until this
build sees something itself. That distinction is permanent and would be needed
by any future asserting authority, so it stays when the arm goes.

Deletion is `git rm -r src/migrations` plus replacing the seam arm with
`Ok(())`, which is byte-for-byte a first run on a fresh seat. Measured cost of
that deletion: one compile error, at the seam.

## Direction

update implementation

## Resolution Signal

Both commands below print nothing, on every admitted host, for seven
consecutive days:

```sh
state="${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/st2"

# 1. No pre-ledger record is left beside any per-harness state dir, so no
#    unread attempt can still need carrying forward.
find "$state/codex" "$state/opencode" -maxdepth 2 -name delivery-state.json -print

# 2. No ledger entry still holds a phase this fleet never observed. While one
#    exists, the translation that produced it is load-bearing.
find "$state/codex" "$state/opencode" -maxdepth 2 -name delivery-ledger.json -print0 \
  | xargs -0 -r jq -r 'select([.entries[].attestation] | any(. == "asserted")) | input_filename'
```

Clause 1 also requires that rollback to a pre-ledger release has stopped being
supported: while it is supported, a rolled-back binary can write a new
`delivery-state.json`, and the roll-forward window it opens is pinned by
`migrations::delivery_state::tests::a_rollback_then_roll_forward_does_not_see_the_record_written_in_between`.

The local half of the trigger — that with no old record present the module
contributes nothing and writes nothing, so removing it cannot change observed
behaviour — is asserted by
`migrations::delivery_state::tests::deletion_trigger_absent_old_record_makes_this_module_a_no_op`.
