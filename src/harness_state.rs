//! Observed harness state: the driver-owned record of what a harness is seen doing.
//!
//! A `harness-state` file (sibling of `status` in the agent's dir) carries the latest observation a
//! session wrapper made of its provider: whether the harness is working, blocked on a human, or
//! ended, plus what its input buffer holds. This is the *observed* axis; `status` remains the
//! *declared* one, and neither speaks for the other. The record is written only by the owning
//! session's driver processes — the wrapper, its channel, or its hooks; one logical owner per
//! record, and nothing outside the driver writes it. Writes happen on state transitions plus a
//! slow heartbeat and follow the presence record's transport discipline: an embedded origin
//! timestamp (never file mtime), atomic tmp+rename writes serialized by a cross-process lock,
//! byte-distinct content on every write that lands, and a derived-only `unknown` — a writer that
//! loses sight of its harness stops heartbeating and lets the record age out rather than
//! refreshing a state it can no longer prove. Restating an unchanged state is free: it touches
//! the record only when the refresh cadence is due, so a chatty producer cannot flood the
//! transport.
