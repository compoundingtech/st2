//! The restart cap (M1b) — st2's crash-loop guard, driven by the job's declared `restart{}` policy
//! (spec.md §4 / R16), so every conformant runner behaves identically on a flapping task.
//!
//! st2 owns liveness (it respawns a dead task on the next reconcile), so it also owns the restart
//! decision. Per task it enforces `delay` spacing, then applies `mode`: `delay` **rate-limits** using
//! a sliding `interval` window (keep restarting once the window clears), while `fail` **parks** the
//! task (give up + surface it) once its failure budget is spent.
//!
//! Those two need different counters, because a rate window cannot express a budget. The supervisor
//! reconciles every 30s by default, so it can start a task at most twice a minute — below the
//! 3-per-minute that the default `attempts 3 / interval 60s` budgets. Counted in a window, `fail`'s
//! budget could never accrue and a permanently-broken task relaunched forever. So `fail` counts
//! launches since the task last *stayed up* for a full `interval`, which is uptime-scoped rather than
//! wall-clock-scoped and cannot be outrun by a coarse cadence. That makes [`FlappingCap::end_pass`]
//! load-bearing: it is how the cap learns a task survived.
//!
//! The clock is injected (`now: Instant`) so every branch is unit-testable without sleeping.
