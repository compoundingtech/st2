const STRUCTURED_REQUEST_HELP: &str = r##"A structured request as a JSON file (`-` reads stdin).

A `decision` proposes one action: exactly one `accept` answer, one `decline` answer and at most
one `request_changes` answer, each naming what happens next. A `choice` names 2 to 5 options,
and `"custom": true` also takes the person's own words. `feedback` asks for text and has no
answers. `why_person` says why no runtime fact or standing instruction settles it. Omit
`recommendation` to make none. An `update` asks nothing: it names `about`, the person's own
run or step or their message to you, and clears once read (`st work update` builds one). Subject kinds: pull_request, issue, document, mission, run,
step, agent, host, commit, link; `revision` pins what was reviewed.

  {"version": 1, "type": "decision",
   "question": "Land #11 then #12?",
   "why_person": "The owner approves merges to the public repository.",
   "reasons": ["Checks are green on both heads."],
   "recommendation": {"answer": "land", "reason": "Both are reviewed."},
   "subjects": [{"kind": "pull_request", "label": "#11",
                 "url": "https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/pull/11", "revision": "HEAD_SHA"}],
   "answers": [
     {"id": "land", "label": "Land #11 then #12", "outcome": "accept",
      "consequence": "I queue #11, then #12."},
     {"id": "keep-open", "label": "Keep both open", "outcome": "decline",
      "consequence": "Nothing merges."},
     {"id": "revise", "label": "Request changes", "outcome": "request_changes",
      "consequence": "I make the changes and ask again."}]}

The person answers with `st work done STEP --answer ID [--text TEXT]`; requesting changes,
feedback and a custom choice need text. The resumed step's `person_answers` carries the answer
as {"type", "outcome", "id", "label", "text"}: read it with `st work show STEP --json` and
act on `id` and `outcome`, not on the words."##;
