//! The controlled-launch body shared by the pi-family wrappers (pi and omp).
//!
//! Both harnesses integrate the same way: an extension loaded into the interactive process, which
//! reaches st2 by spawning `st2 driver <harness>-channel`. Two facts have to be handed to that
//! extension, and neither is discoverable from inside the harness. The first is *which* st2 to run
//! — resolving `st2` from `PATH` would let a replaced control plane and its live agents disagree,
//! which the R11 control-plane replacement guarantee exists to prevent — so the wrapper exports its
//! own executable path. The second is the catalog and identity the channel must bind.
//!
//! The wrapper also owns presence for the same reason the Claude wrapper does: the extension lives
//! only as long as the provider's process, and a measured SIGKILL of pi produces no terminal record
//! at all (`docs/vrs/.experiments/2026-08-18-pi-harness-integration.md`). Presence therefore decays
//! by staleness, exactly as for the other harnesses.
//!
//! The fork between the two harnesses is a [`HarnessKind`] descriptor, mirroring the
//! [`crate::pi_channel::ChannelKind`] fork the family's channel side already uses: the same fork
//! solved the same way twice rather than two different ways. What stays in each harness module is
//! what is genuinely per-harness — its module doc, its extension asset, its channel env NAMES (the
//! whole point of two sets is that an omp seat can never adopt a stray pi configuration), and, for
//! omp, its version gate.
