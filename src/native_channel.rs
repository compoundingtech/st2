//! A native channel is a child of the interactive harness, speaking newline-delimited JSON over
//! stdio: the Claude MCP watcher ([`crate::claude_mcp`]) and the pi-family channel
//! ([`crate::pi_channel`]). What a delivered inbox message looks like to the model, and how a
//! frame is terminated on the wire, are st2's decisions rather than each channel's — so they are
//! decided once, here.
