//! Agent selection: immutable IDs and mutable addresses.
//!
//! Decision 0015 splits one overloaded string into two typed namespaces. The immutable **agent ID**
//! is catalog-global and never routes for humans; the mutable **agent address** is unique per
//! logical host and is the only thing an ordinary human reference resolves against. Equal bytes in
//! the two namespaces do not collide, so an exact-ID selector performs only ID lookup and never
//! falls through to address lookup — that is what keeps an existing semantic ID from silently
//! staying alive as a route after a rename.
//!
//! Ordinary references are decided by a fail-closed candidate set rather than a precedence rule,
//! because a dotted semantic address and a host-qualified bus address are indistinguishable by
//! shape: `dotfiles.fractal.chat` is a legal bare address and a legal `<host>.<address>` split.
//! Collecting both readings and requiring exactly one surviving subject makes the question
//! decidable without guessing which dot is the separator.
//!
//! Every subject's ID is its effective ID: the explicit `id` a declaration carries, else the
//! `<host>.<identity>` bus identity, which is what an unmigrated catalog answers with. Nothing
//! here reads an activation gate — the address model is normative on any catalog.
