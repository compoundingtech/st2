//! Controlled pi launch with a session-owned presence lease.
//!
//! pi has no MCP and no app-server: its integration point is an extension loaded into the
//! interactive process, and that extension reaches st2 by spawning `st2 driver pi-channel`. The
//! launch body itself is shared with omp — the family's other extension-driven harness — in
//! [`crate::pi_family_session`]; what lives here is what is genuinely pi's: its extension asset,
//! its channel variable names, and the release its harness-context arithmetic was measured on.
