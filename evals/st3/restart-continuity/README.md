# Restart continuity for st3

This version 2 eval migrates `restart-continuity` from `compoundingtech/evals` revision `3db48ab56d40ce27dfd94f89d2db9b692d93836a`.

It also absorbs the duplicate-delivery check from `inbox-hygiene` at the same revision.

The st3 graph owns the complete plan before work starts. It records two assigned work phases, the cold restart, five stable products, nested item progress, verification, and cleanup.

A mechanical injector restarts `rc.dev` after item 2. It sends one repeated Small Talk delivery through the st3 API after the new incarnation becomes ready.

The worker must use the graph, `PROGRESS.md`, and git history to resume with item 3. The judges reject a skipped item, a repeated stable item result, a missing product, incorrect ownership, or an invalid message sequence.

This migrated form has not had a paid run. Review `eval.kdl`, the personas, the injector, and all judges before the first run.
