# st2 Agent Spec field-change conformance specification

This draft defines desired st2 conformance behavior and st2-specific gaps. It
does not redefine the Agent Spec. A general field-change rule in this document
is proposed until the canonical evals specification and proof corpus adopt it.

## Rules common to every field

Compare normalized effects and preserve unrelated work. Prove exact ownership
before destructive action. Each host acts only on its local projection. Fence
and remove before a conflicting add. Notify surviving agents only after commit.

A dry-run makes no writes. Dry-run and quiet status name only affected IDs,
with the change, action or refusal, and what the proof covers. They include
desired and observed fingerprints and the exact incarnation when relevant.
`hold` waits without the requested lifecycle change. `refuse` makes no change
because validation or proof failed.

Each **Authoring** link points to the canonical evals Agent Spec at exact commit
`e9b53e79b05b1c0e1d7eea02db2eaba47376fe05`, which is pinned to st2
`9887b28`. It is the authoring authority, not proof of current st2 runtime
behavior. **st2 source** and **Evidence** links show this implementation on the
PR base.

## Shared declaration admission

st2 and managed publishers such as Axe consume one declaration boundary from
the `agent-spec` library. They do not maintain sibling KDL parsers or reconstruct
declarations from runner-normalized `AgentSpec` values.

```text
exact UTF-8 source bytes
        |
        v
agent-spec lossless declaration parser
        |-- typed KDL tree, order, duplicates, spans, exact source
        `-- syntax and declaration-shape diagnostics
                  |
                  v
        core Agent Spec admission
          |                    |
          v                    v
   st2 catalog policy     Axe managed policy
          |                    |
          `---------+----------'
                    v
          digest-bound publication
```

### Strict and lossless are separate properties

The parser retains the exact source bytes and a typed tree containing every
node, argument, property, child, duplicate occurrence, source order, and source
span. An unknown provider field therefore remains available to its owning
policy; parsing never makes it valid by dropping it. Publication writes the
captured bytes, not a serialization of the typed tree.

Strict parsing rejects invalid KDL and declaration-shape errors such as an
unexpected top-level node, a task without its required name, or a reserved but
unsupported construct. It does not silently substitute a default for a value
whose supplied type or shape is invalid. Syntax failure has no document;
shape failure retains the document for diagnostics but cannot be admitted.

The shared result has this semantic shape:

```rust
struct DeclaredParse {
    document: Option<DeclaredDocument>,
    diagnostics: Vec<AdmissionDiagnostic>,
}

struct DeclaredDocument {
    source_name: PathBuf,
    source: String,
    nodes: Vec<DeclaredNode>,
    agents: Vec<DeclaredAgent>,
}
```

Convenience accessors may select a field, but the underlying collection remains
ordered and duplicate-preserving. A policy that requires uniqueness checks the
collection; it cannot inherit first-wins or last-wins behavior from an accessor.

### Policy layers add constraints without reparsing

Admission is the conjunction of ordered layers over the same immutable
`DeclaredDocument` and exact source digest:

| Layer | Owner | Decides |
| --- | --- | --- |
| syntax and declaration shape | `agent-spec` | whether a complete lossless typed document exists |
| core Agent Spec | `agent-spec` | canonical field types, uniqueness, normalization, and core invariants |
| catalog and runtime | st2 | target identity, full-catalog conflicts, host projection, and publication safety |
| managed declaration | Axe | managed launch, persona, Resource, provenance, and provider-specific constraints |

st2 never reports that Axe policy passed, and Axe never substitutes its own
answer for core admission. Axe consumes the shared parse and core result, then
adds managed diagnostics. This makes a stronger managed refusal and a weaker
core acceptance explicitly different policy verdicts rather than contradictory
parses. A publication request fixes the ordered policy profile for that request;
the receipt names the profile and binds it to the candidate digest.

### Diagnostics are structured data

Every layer emits the same diagnostic envelope. Stable automation branches on
`code`, `severity`, and `layer`, never on prose.

```json
{
  "schema": "st2.agent-spec-diagnostic.v1",
  "code": "task-name-missing",
  "severity": "error",
  "layer": "declaration",
  "source": "agents/dev3/worker/agent.kdl",
  "span": { "offset": 42, "length": 3, "line": 3, "column": 3 },
  "fieldPath": ["agent", "worker", "pty"],
  "message": "pty task must have one positional string name",
  "help": null
}
```

`layer` is one of `syntax`, `declaration`, `core`, `catalog`, `managed`, or
`publication`. `source`, `span`, `fieldPath`, and `help` are optional only when
the failing layer has no corresponding source location. Human rendering may add
context, but JSON preserves the envelope and all causal diagnostics. Dependency
and I/O failures use their own codes and retain the failing path or operation;
they are not collapsed into an "invalid JSON" or generic admission message.

## Digest-bound publication and re-admission

Publication separates the core transaction st2 can prove under its catalog lock
from the stronger managed verdict Axe owns:

```text
Axe                         st2                         live catalog
 |                           |                              |
 | parse + core + managed    |                              |
 | candidate, digest C       |                              |
 |--- publish(C, expected) ->|                              |
 |                           | acquire local authoring lock |
 |                           | re-capture candidate == C    |
 |                           | core-admit locked overlay    |
 |                           | atomic durable replace ----->|
 |                           | read back == C               |
 |                           | core re-admit published view |
 |<-- receipt(C, before, C)--| release lock                 |
 | read live == receipt C    |                              |
 | core + managed re-admit   |                              |
 | report managed success    |                              |
```

The st2 transaction performs these steps in order:

1. Capture the candidate into immutable staging, retain its exact bytes and
   typed declaration, and compute its lowercase SHA-256 source or bundle digest.
2. Acquire the catalog's exclusive local authoring lock. No cross-host lock,
   external lock service, or shared receipt is involved.
3. Re-read the current target under the lock and require the caller's exact
   absent-or-SHA-256 precondition. Require the staged digest to equal the
   caller's input digest.
4. Overlay the staged candidate on the locked catalog snapshot and run shared
   parsing, core admission, and st2 catalog policy over that exact projection.
5. Publish by an atomic, durable file or bundle transition. Preserve exact
   candidate bytes and synchronize the containing directory before success.
6. While retaining the lock, open the published regular file without following
   symlinks, require its digest to equal the input digest, and rerun shared parse,
   core admission, and catalog policy against the published view.
7. Commit the catalog generation and return a typed receipt containing the
   parser source revision, policy profile, input digest, before digest when
   present, and verified after digest. Only then release the lock.

`st2 validate --json` emits `st2.validate.v2`; successful JSON publication emits
`st2.agent-publish.v2`. Both identify the `st2.core+catalog.v1` policy profile
and the same `agentSpecRevision`. A hermetic clean build uses the complete
40-hex source revision. Native dirty and revisionless builds use explicit local
identities that cannot compare equal to a clean hermetic receipt. The byte-only
`st2 agent digest --json` contract remains `st2.agent-source-digest.v1` because
it makes no parser or policy claim.

Failure before the atomic transition publishes nothing. Failure after it never
returns a success receipt: the catalog transaction restores only when its
generation record proves the exact previous bytes and target; otherwise its
durable recovery state reports an indeterminate publication and blocks dependent
work. Re-admission is not replaced by comparing bytes alone.

For a managed publication, Axe binds its candidate verdict to the same input
digest, accepts only a matching st2 receipt, then reads the live declaration and
reruns shared parse, core admission, and its managed policy. It reports managed
success only when the live digest still equals the receipt's verified after
digest. A later writer produces `superseded`, not a false success or an
unproved rollback. st2 mutation commands that apply only core policy report a
core publication and do not claim managed admission.

## Field rules

<h3 id="f01">F01 Source form or path</h3>

Formatting, comments, order, and a source path change are `no-op` only when all
normalized fields, render plans, task IDs, fallback `cwd`, exact resolved paths,
and Resource references match. Otherwise, classify the changed effect. A
`no-op` writes and notifies nothing but does not block healing of absent or dead
work.

Authoring: [pinned discovery, identity, and host][evals-discovery]. st2 source:
[KDL parser](../../../crates/agent-spec/src/kdl_format.rs). Evidence:
[discovery](../../../crates/agent-spec/src/discovery.rs).

<h3 id="f02">F02 <code>identity</code></h3>

Retire the old identity and add the new identity. Do not infer a rename. Prove
exact old ownership before a conflicting add. Report both actions, or refuse
when proof is missing.

Authoring: [pinned discovery and identity][evals-discovery]. st2 source:
[`AgentSpec::identity`](../../../crates/agent-spec/src/spec.rs). Evidence:
[reconciliation](../../../src/reconcile.rs).

<h3 id="f03">F03 <code>host</code></h3>

Each supervisor evaluates only local membership. A complete present-to-absent
change removes locally; absent-to-present adds locally. This is not migration,
and the hosts do not coordinate. Skew can cause overlap or absence. Each host
keeps its local last-known-good ownership.

Authoring: [pinned discovery and host][evals-discovery]. st2 source:
[`AgentSpec::host`](../../../crates/agent-spec/src/spec.rs). Evidence:
[host filtering](../../../src/reconcile.rs).

<h3 id="f04">F04 <code>type</code></h3>

An omitted value and `service` have the same effect. Any other value refuses
changes to the related agent, tasks, and files before launch, write, or teardown.

Authoring: [pinned complete declaration][evals-fields]. st2 source:
[`JobType` and `RawSpec::job_type`](../../../crates/agent-spec/src/spec.rs).
Evidence: [validation](../../../src/validate.rs).

<h3 id="f05">F05 <code>role</code></h3>

Update observable declaration metadata only. Do not change the fingerprint,
workspace files, notification state, or a healthy task.

Authoring: [pinned complete declaration][evals-fields]. st2 source:
[`AgentSpec::role`](../../../crates/agent-spec/src/spec.rs). Evidence:
[KDL lowering](../../../crates/agent-spec/src/kdl_format.rs).

<h3 id="f06">F06 <code>workspace</code></h3>

For a healthy survivor, keep the process and commit the new live context. After
commit, write one durable event with the old and new paths, then try
transport-neutral DING through the configured adapter. Do not restart or
replace. Absent or dead work boots with the latest workspace and no notification.

Related render changes use F08 and join the same event. Explicit task `cwd` is
F11 launch drift.

Authoring: [pinned complete declaration][evals-fields]. st2 source:
[`AgentSpec::workspace`](../../../crates/agent-spec/src/spec.rs). Evidence:
[`cwd` resolution](../../../src/run.rs).

<h3 id="f07">F07 Resource <code>name</code>, <code>_tag</code>, or <code>uri</code></h3>

Update typed Resource data without changing the launch fingerprint. Notify a
survivor once after commit. New or replaced work reads the latest state at boot
and gets no change notification.

Authoring gap: the [pinned supported-field list][evals-supported-fields] and
st2 `9887b28` predate Resource bindings. Current st2 source:
[`Resource`](../../../crates/agent-spec/src/spec.rs). Evidence:
[declared Resource projection](../../../src/agents.rs).

<h3 id="f08">F08 <code>render {}</code> operation, template, or resolved target</h3>

Prove ownership for every affected local owner before writing. Conflicts refuse
all affected owners. Write only changed bytes, then notify survivors that can
see the committed target. Unchanged bytes do not notify. Deletion needs explicit
desired state and ownership and never removes a catalog source declaration.

Authoring: [pinned render contract][evals-render]. st2 implementation and
evidence: [materializer](../../../src/materialize.rs).

<h3 id="f09">F09 Task set: <code>pty</code>, <code>exec</code>, or compact <code>ding</code></h3>

Add only the unique missing child. Remove and clean only an old child with exact
ownership proof. A compact DING task uses the same rule. Do not change siblings.

Authoring: [pinned compact and explicit tasks][evals-tasks]. st2 source:
[`Task` and `TaskKind`](../../../crates/agent-spec/src/spec.rs). Evidence:
[task reconciliation](../../../src/reconcile.rs).

<h3 id="f10">F10 Task <code>name</code> or explicit <code>id</code></h3>

Remove the exact old ID and add the new ID. Do not infer one incarnation.
Report both actions, or `hold` or `refuse` when ownership proof is missing.

Authoring: [pinned explicit tasks][evals-tasks]. st2 source:
[`Task::name` and `Task::id`](../../../crates/agent-spec/src/spec.rs). Evidence:
[task reconciliation](../../../src/reconcile.rs).

<h3 id="f11">F11 Spawn inputs</h3>

Task `kind`, `command`, `argv`, explicit `cwd`, and task `env`, plus agent
`env`, `tags`, `supervisor`, and any other start input form the versioned launch
fingerprint. Absent or dead work boots with the latest inputs.

A healthy mismatch stays alive as `drifted` or `unknown`; report both
fingerprints. Command drift stays visible and does not restart automatically.
Replacement needs authority for that task and a fresh exact-incarnation check.
An `env` key named `PTY_ROOT` is only a task launch input.

Authoring: [pinned tasks][evals-tasks] and [environment][evals-environment]. The
[pinned explicit-task list][evals-task-fields] and st2 `9887b28` predate `argv`.
Current st2 source: [`AgentSpec` and `Task`](../../../crates/agent-spec/src/spec.rs).
Evidence: [spawn construction](../../../src/run.rs).

<h3 id="f12">F12 Future policy</h3>

Agent or task `keep`, restart `attempts`, `interval`, `delay`, and `mode`, and
task `lifecycle` are future policy. Adopt healthy work. `adopt-only` holds absent
or dead work; `service` reconciles it normally. Invalid policy refuses changes
to the related agent and tasks.

Authoring: [pinned complete declaration][evals-fields]. The
[pinned explicit-task list][evals-task-fields] and st2 `9887b28` predate task
`lifecycle`. Current st2 source:
[`Restart` and `TaskLifecycle`](../../../crates/agent-spec/src/spec.rs).
Evidence: [policy planning](../../../src/reconcile.rs).

<h3 id="f13">F13 <code>retired #true</code></h3>

Fence, stop, and clean every declared ID with exact ownership proof, and prevent
relaunch. An agent identity removal in the same change uses F02. A child removal
uses F09 or F10 proof.

Authoring: [pinned complete declaration][evals-fields]. st2 source:
[`AgentSpec::retired`](../../../crates/agent-spec/src/spec.rs). Evidence:
[retirement planning](../../../src/reconcile.rs).

<h3 id="f14">F14 Compact agent fields</h3>

Compact `command`, `argv`, `env`, `lifecycle`, and `ding` convert to the
generated agent PTY and sidecar. The tasks use F09, F11, and F12. Compact syntax
adds no other behavior.

Authoring: [pinned compact tasks][evals-tasks]. That document and st2 `9887b28`
predate compact `argv` and `lifecycle`. Current st2 source:
[KDL fields](../../../crates/agent-spec/src/kdl_format.rs). Evidence:
[`RawSpec` lowering](../../../crates/agent-spec/src/spec.rs).

<h3 id="f15">F15 Provider and ignored fields</h3>

Core st2 ignores `harness`, `model`, `persona`, `permissions`, `transport`,
`strategy`, `meta`, and provider extensions. They do not change core equality,
wake behavior, or actions. Providers may convert them into F05 through F14;
core acts only on that concrete output.

Authoring: [pinned complete declaration][evals-fields]. st2 source:
[KDL field boundary](../../../crates/agent-spec/src/kdl_format.rs). Evidence:
[`RawSpec` lowering](../../../crates/agent-spec/src/spec.rs).

<h3 id="f16">F16 Invalid or incomplete state</h3>

Refuse changes to an agent, task, or file when its desired or actual state is
unreadable, invalid, ambiguous, or conflicting. Keep last-known-good ownership
and perform no destructive action to that work. Independent agents, tasks, and
files can continue when their input and ownership proof are complete.

Authoring: [pinned validation, health, and lifecycle][evals-lifecycle]. st2
source: [`RawSpec` and `AgentSpec`](../../../crates/agent-spec/src/spec.rs).
Evidence: [validation](../../../src/validate.rs) and
[reconciliation](../../../src/reconcile.rs).

<h3 id="f17">F17 Agent <code>name</code> and <code>description</code></h3>

Update observable declaration and runtime presentation metadata only. Neither
field participates in identity, routing, selection, authorization, state paths,
launch fingerprints, workspaces, inbox events, DING, or lifecycle. The roster
reads the declaration directly; sibling `name` files are ignored.

For a healthy managed PTY, patch the exact runtime task ID in place. Every owned
PTY receives the versioned stable-actor and optional-description tag snapshot;
only the primary task named `agent` maps optional name to native display
metadata. Clearing removes only the corresponding st2-owned value. Preserve
unrelated tags and secondary display conventions. An unchanged projection is a
no-op. Failure reports and retries without stop, reap, restart, replacement, or
flapping accounting. Absent work receives the same projection at spawn.

Authoring: canonical Agent Spec presentation fields after the matching evals
change lands. st2 source: [`AgentSpec`](../../../crates/agent-spec/src/spec.rs),
[roster](../../../src/agents.rs), and [reconciliation](../../../src/reconcile.rs).
Evidence: parser, roster, exact-ID metadata, and no-restart presentation tests.

Catalog and PTY roots are host runtime inputs, not Agent Spec fields. Their
migration contract is outside this VRS. See
[#85](https://github.com/compoundingtech/st2/issues/85).

## Unsupported moved intent

A possible future same-host map could bind one exact old address to one exact
new address. It would need one-to-one, acyclic mapping, exact old-incarnation
proof, and no destination conflict. It is not an alias, history, global
authority, or host migration. Only an atomic address change with no
process-visible or fingerprint change could preserve a process. `identity`,
`ST_AGENT`, F11, and host changes remove before add. Removing a pending map
would refuse. The parser and runtime do not support moved intent.

Source: [KDL parser](../../../crates/agent-spec/src/kdl_format.rs).

## Execution order

Plan the snapshot, normalized difference, ownership, conflicts, and rollback.
Refuse before mutation when a required proof is missing. Then omit empty phases
from this fixed order:

1. **FENCE:** prevent launch of old, replaced, and retired IDs.
2. **REMOVE/QUIESCE:** stop exact old incarnations and release their resources.
3. **MATERIALIZE:** write final state for survivors and additions.
4. **ADD/BOOT:** boot missing or explicitly replaced work from final bytes.
5. **NOTIFY:** notify survivors after commit and coalesce related changes.
6. **VERIFY/REPORT:** verify exact results; roll back only when proved,
   otherwise hold or refuse.

Independent agents, tasks, and files progress separately when their input and
ownership proof are complete. The order does not coordinate hosts or authorize
replacement of drifted work.

## Current implementation gaps

- **G01, F01/F04/F15:** watcher passes lack semantic differences, and invalid
  KDL `type` can lower to `service`. [Parser](../../../crates/agent-spec/src/kdl_format.rs)
- **G02, F06-F08:** render ownership and idempotent writes exist, but dependency
  targeting and post-commit notification do not. [Materializer](../../../src/materialize.rs)
- **G03, F02/F09-F13:** ID-only adoption lacks fingerprint and incarnation
  binding. Exact removal and simultaneous remove/retire are absent. Malformed
  restart fields use defaults. See [#40](https://github.com/compoundingtech/st2/issues/40),
  the [model](../../../crates/agent-spec/src/spec.rs), and
  [reconciler](../../../src/reconcile.rs).
- **G04, F06/F11:** workspace is the current startup `cwd` fallback, not live
  context. [Runner](../../../src/run.rs)
- **G05, F03:** host filtering exists, but exact old-projection removal does
  not. No cross-host mechanism is required. [Host filter](../../../src/reconcile.rs)
- **G06, notifications:** inbox and DING exist, but reconciliation writes no
  stable change event. [Message](../../../src/message.rs) and
  [DING](../../../src/ding/mod.rs)
- **G07, planning/reporting:** st2 cannot plan and commit all related agent,
  task, and file changes as one operation, and it has no true dry-run;
  `materialize-only` writes. See [#53](https://github.com/compoundingtech/st2/issues/53)
  and [runner](../../../src/run.rs).
- **G08, moved intent:** parser, status, and executor support are absent; syntax
  is unspecified. [Parser](../../../crates/agent-spec/src/kdl_format.rs)
- **G09, F17 release ordering:** source authoring requires Nix emitters to mark
  generated declarations before the compatible st2 binary is activated. The
  pinned merged PTY dependency provides the exact-ID atomic metadata-patch API;
  compatible st2 and Nix provenance adoption must still deploy as one gated cohort.
- **G10, shared admission:** st2 runner lowering, validation, and publication
  and Axe managed admission consume shared discovery and retained lossless
  parsing. Axe accepts strict validation and publication receipts only when
  their schema, `st2.core+catalog.v1` profile, and full parser revision match its
  own shared parser. After st2 admits and publishes under the catalog lock, Axe
  verifies the receipt digests, opens the exact published regular file through
  descriptor-relative no-follow traversal, runs core and managed admission,
  then reads and verifies the digest again; intervening drift is reported as
  `superseded`. The cross-tool parse, admission, revision, and publication
  invariant is closed. The common diagnostic envelope remains open: st2
  validation issues do not yet carry the specified layer, span, field path, and
  help fields, so Axe cannot preserve them when incorporating core diagnostics.

## Acceptance cases

- Source `no-op` changes nothing while an independently dead task still heals.
- Lossless parsing preserves unknown fields, duplicates, order, exact source,
  and spans. Syntax and shape mutations produce stable structured diagnostics;
  no invalid supplied value becomes an omitted default.
- st2 core admission and Axe managed admission consume the same parsed document
  and core verdict. A managed-only refusal is labeled as managed policy, while a
  core error blocks both without a second parse or contradictory message.
- Concurrent publication proves the caller's before and input digests under the
  catalog lock. The success receipt follows read-back and core re-admission of
  the exact published digest; managed success additionally follows Axe
  re-admission of that same live digest. A superseding writer is reported as
  `superseded` rather than success.
- Role and policy changes preserve healthy work; invalid values refuse.
- A workspace survivor gets one event. Absent or dead work boots the latest
  workspace. Explicit task `cwd` drift stays visible.
- Changed render or Resource state commits before one combined event. Unchanged,
  failed, rolled-back, periodic, new, replaced, and retired paths emit none.
- DING failure retains the event. Replay has no extra effect, and inbox events
  do not cause inbox events.
- Add, remove, rename, and retirement affect exact IDs, including simultaneous
  child removal. Legacy or partial proof holds or refuses.
- Matching fingerprints adopt. Mismatches drift. Explicit replacement proves
  the exact incarnation through fence, quiesce, materialize, and boot.
- Name and description changes update roster and exact PTY metadata while task
  ID, PID, creation identity, and generation remain unchanged. Repeating the
  desired projection emits no metadata event; clearing removes only owned
  presentation values. A genuine retirement still follows ordinary teardown.
- Host projections converge after overlap, absence, and reconnection without a
  shared receipt.
- Moved intent rejects cycles, conflicts, and host changes. It removes before
  add unless a future atomic address change can preserve the process.
- A refusal for one related set of agents, tasks, or files does not block
  independent work whose input and ownership proof are complete. Every result
  names the affected IDs, action, and what the proof covers.
