# Conversations and messaging live E2E — 2026-09-23

This audit exercised the existing Hetz/Silber st3 network before and after the
conversation and delivery hardening on the `st3` branch. Tests used isolated
mailboxes and archived every probe message after inspection.

## Baseline

- Installed binary: `/home/myobie/.local/bin/st3` 0.1.0, SHA-256
  `db597cbf…`.
- Isolated parties:
  `agent/e2e-conversations-20260923t1217z-live-e2e/hetz` and
  `agent/e2e-conversations-20260923t1217z-live-e2e/silber`.
- Cross-host evidence: seven Silber-owned sessions were visible and readable
  from Hetz. Direct SSH access to Silber was unavailable, so this proves
  replicated visibility from the current node rather than a remote shell run.
- Independent standing-agent evidence: COS sent
  `message/76a79ac91850e1af` immediately after this agent compacted. This agent
  replied with `message/216b65705e6f4964`; the user then compacted COS and
  confirmed that the reply still arrived.

The baseline matrix passed message send (JSON, tags, reply references, and KDL
printing), explicit mailbox list/filter/count/archive, canonical and bare reads,
raw and multi-message reads, recipient replies, idempotent archive, thread
rendering, session pagination, timeline import across the seven Silber sessions,
and deterministic session export (1,163 files).

The live run exposed five compatibility defects:

1. A reply by the original sender addressed the sender instead of the other
   participant.
2. `conversations sessions --all --limit 200 --json` could not decode a `u128`
   usage timestamp.
3. First-page session and timeline reads could surface transient
   `PageCursorExpired` errors during write churn.
4. `read` and `read --archive` returned the lifecycle state from before their
   mutation.
5. Bare `conversations ls` ignored `ST_AGENT` and listed fleet-wide messages.

## Hardening

The CLI now routes replies to the other participant and rejects outsiders,
decodes usage timestamps portably, preserves unknown future timeline variants,
retries only cursor-free first pages, refetches after lifecycle mutations, and
requires an explicit mailbox argument or a non-empty `ST_AGENT`.

Delivery hardening also adds bounded Codex snapshot retries, ignores late
request IDs, and allows a known-idle harness to recover after three failed
snapshot attempts. PTY launches are serialized across processes, wait for the
exact published incarnation, and leave a durable pending fence when publication
cannot be confirmed. Reconciliation withdraws stale staged wakes with daemon
authority and provider-auth failures are no longer considered ready.

The two blockers from review of the superseded PR were addressed:

- failed Codex thread reads no longer permanently fence an otherwise idle
  delivery;
- OpenCode import uses a checked global sequence and bounded suffix, so more
  than 16 completed tool calls cannot duplicate timeline IDs.

Nix exposed and verified three additional portability/concurrency fixes:
shell-probe tests no longer depend on `/bin/sh`, takeover tests no longer depend
on `/bin/bash` or `/bin/sleep`, and the terminal capability key is published
atomically so simultaneous attachments cannot read a partially written key.

The first disposable wake mission exposed one final lifecycle race: an explicit
`finally stop` could be overwritten for one reconciliation pass by the mission's
top-level agent declaration, briefly launching a second incarnation during
cleanup. A same-generation stop now remains authoritative, with a regression
that proves mission declarations cannot relaunch the stopped agent.

## Verification

- `nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.st3 --no-link`
  - st-runtime: 19 passed
  - st3 library: 362 passed
  - st3 CLI: 71 passed
  - client-v0 CLI/contract: 20 passed
  - examples/evals: 27 passed
  - operational-state contract: 12 passed
  - st3-migrate: 17 passed
  - st3-schema: 15 passed
- `cargo test -p st2 codex_app_server::tests --lib`: 70 passed.
- `cargo test -p st3-client`: 17 passed across unit and integration suites.
- The terminal-key concurrency regression passed 20 consecutive focused runs.
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `git diff --check`, and
  `cargo run -p st3-client-codegen -- --check` passed.

Source-binary probes against the pre-upgrade daemon also passed: a 200-session
page decoded with `has_more=true`; 20 consecutive fresh timeline pages survived
write churn; scoped bare list behavior was exact; and isolated send/read/reply/
archive checks returned the committed lifecycle states and routed both reply
directions correctly.

## Post-install network proof

- Installed binary: `/home/myobie/.local/bin/st3` 0.1.0, SHA-256
  `e8605015679ca43f37862b9b564ac1d96e0d49e8c771fd0a982df2f0266bcaab`.
- Restarting the daemon and replication services did not restart the standing
  st3 harness; it retained incarnation
  `3171390:2026-09-23T12:07:01.885Z`.
- After two successful disposable runs, `mission/fleet/st3` was published at
  store index 56002 with `gpt-6-sol` and `medium` effort for future Codex
  harness incarnations. Publishing the definition left the current incarnation
  unchanged.
- Isolated parties
  `agent/e2e-conversations-20260923t1331z-postinstall/{a,b}` exercised KDL
  printing, tagged JSON send, explicit and `ST_AGENT`-scoped list/count,
  refusal of an unscoped list, read, raw read, both reply directions, JSON and
  tree threads, committed `read --archive` state, multi-archive, and repeated
  archive. Root `message/3260aac1a8973723` reused the exact archive event
  `4df38bf09dcce3bd79de5d7e72d645e037adfa6ceea13b0db1b4802658db021f`;
  both probe inboxes ended with zero open messages.
- A 200-session page decoded with `has_more=true`; 20 consecutive fresh
  session/timeline reads passed; two exports were byte-for-byte identical with
  1,182 files each.
- `machine/Silber` was reachable, its peer status was `up`, and the peers had
  the same graph digest. Replication reported zero pending, unknown, invalid, or
  unhealthy-projection records. `st3 doctor --strict` passed every check.
- Disposable run `mission-run/live-wake-probe-20260923-v2` proved a real
  graph-to-harness wake independently of message staging. Agent
  `agent/live-wake-probe-20260923-v2/probe` had exactly one start request and
  one running incarnation (`3655987:2026-09-23T13:47:09.129Z`), claimed once,
  submitted once with “Wake reached the harness,” completed, received exactly
  one terminate request, and ended stopped. No cleanup relaunch occurred.

## Known external constraint

A historical, now-undesired `pty-rust` Claude harness reported an expired login.
The current desired fleet passes strict driver-readiness checks. Reusing that
Claude account will still require an interactive login; it does not block the
Codex conversation and delivery path proved here.
