# st2 requirements

## Context

st2 implements the executable agent contract in
[`compoundingtech/evals/AGENT-SPEC.md`](https://github.com/compoundingtech/evals/blob/main/AGENT-SPEC.md).
The vision is defined in [vision.md](./vision.md). These requirements are the
current ratified product floor, not the entire future scheduler roadmap; new
scheduling and workflow constraints belong here only after their behavior is
accepted.

## Assumptions

- **A01 Declared fleet:** Each runnable agent has one current authored
  declaration and one pinned host.
- **A02 Trusted private fleet:** The catalog, runtime state, and participating
  hosts belong to one trusted operator; st2 is not an adversarial multi-tenant
  boundary.
- **A03 Durable host state:** Each host preserves its catalog and runtime state
  across process restarts. Whole-disk loss and backup are outside st2.
- **A04 Eventual transport:** Hosts may disconnect. Fabric is the preferred
  transport. Git over SSH is supported. No product behavior may require a
  Fabric-only capability. st2 does not guarantee network availability.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs

- **T01 Explicit limits:** A documented unsupported case is preferable to a
  hidden distributed guarantee.

## Requirements

### Must implement the agent contract

- **R01 Agent-spec compliance:** st2 validates and implements every agent-spec
  capability it claims to support, and identifies unsupported capabilities.
- **R02 Canonical KDL and declaration identity:** Hand-authored KDL is the
  canonical declaration; any generator is optional and its output is
  inspectable before reconciliation. Declarations are discovered recursively.
  An explicit `identity` and `host` pair is authoritative independent of its
  folder path, while either omitted field retains path-derived defaults and
  mismatch diagnostics. The declaration's parent remains its state/resource
  anchor. Dot-prefixed and other organizational folders have no implicit
  lifecycle meaning; discovery excludes `.git` and `.st2` control directories
  at any depth, the catalog-root `pty` runtime directory, and state namespaces
  directly owned by a declaration.
- **R03 Host-pinned placement:** Every runnable agent or task resolves to its
  declared host; host-local roots own reconciliation.

### Must provide intelligent host supervision

- **R04 Root supervision:** Every machine has exactly one root agent. The
  deterministic st2 reconciler keeps declared local processes converged; the
  root observes host-local runtime health, diagnoses failures, performs bounded
  recovery, and escalates what it cannot resolve.
- **R31 Reachable restart bounds:** Within one supervisor run, restart
  accounting is per task and only successful launches spend the declared
  budget. `delay` is the minimum launch spacing in either mode. In delay mode,
  `attempts` limits launches over the sliding `interval` window without parking
  the task. In fail mode, `attempts` is reachable independent of reconcile
  cadence: a task that repeatedly launches and dies without being observed
  alive on every completed accounting pass for a full `interval` is parked for
  the remainder of its owning supervisor run after its successful-launch
  budget is exhausted, unless that run grants an explicit per-task unpark
  request. Granting the request clears exactly that task's park decision and
  restart accounting; it does not release another parked task or perturb a
  healthy task, including an identically named task owned by another supervisor
  scope. A completed pass that does not observe the task alive breaks accrued
  recovery uptime rather than forgiving failures through silence.
- **R32 Bounded helper teardown:** After st2 spawns a bounded non-interactive
  helper, input delivery failure or deadline expiry targets the helper's entire
  process group, not only its direct child, so teardown includes descendants
  that outlive that child. st2 either reaps the direct child before returning or
  transfers wait ownership to a background reaper; the failure remains bounded
  and reports its originating input error or timeout.
- **R34 Bounded helper output capture:** Capturing a spawned non-interactive
  helper's stdout/stderr consumes memory bounded by a fixed per-stream cap
  independent of the child's output volume and of how many captures run
  concurrently. When a stream exceeds the cap, the retained bytes are that
  stream's tail, and truncation is observable. A caller that must consume a
  stream whole (structured data for parsing) opts in through an explicitly
  named capture path, so an unbounded read is always visible at its call site.
- **R22 Quiet coordination after events:** A network with minimal or default
  personas stays quiet while useful work continues. Agents coordinate only after
  an inbox DING, a durable failure, a real blocker, a completion or decision
  handoff, or a declared schedule with a name. They continue until they resolve
  the need or hand it off. Repeated status messages and peer polling are not
  substitutes. Normal supervisors handle failures and blocked work. They do not
  continuously manage healthy work. A custom supervisor persona can require
  more frequent coordination. CoS is only an example. st2 does not define or
  require that role, and it gives the role no standard authority. Transport
  loss does not stop independent host-local work.

### Must preserve delivery and launch behavior

- **R05 DING/archive semantics:** Inbox delivery, archive precedence, retries,
  suppression, and restart recovery are deterministic and tested. DING may
  interrupt agent work, but it must not alter or submit a human's active draft;
  an unknown interaction state defers delivery.
- **R06 Restartable launch definitions:** A restarted PTY or exec receives the
  complete effective launch definition, including environment and supported
  launch fields.
- **R07 Verified hooks:** Required hook content is installed explicitly and
  verified before a rendered agent depends on it. The selected receipt carries
  the binary's real source identity regardless of build system. Ordered
  upgrades are automatic; selecting an older, unorderable, or unreadable exact
  hook set requires explicit replacement authority. A selection change does not
  invalidate another running binary's previously installed immutable set. Hook
  interpreters and runtime dependencies are portable and explicit on every
  supported package environment.
- **R33 Provider-visible session restoration:** A shipped session-start hook
  restores fresh, non-empty durable context and its boot ritual through the
  provider's supported model-visible output contract. The complete context is
  preserved without truncation or an argument-size boundary. Missing or stale
  context is an ordinary cold start, and unavailable enrichment dependencies
  fail open without blocking provider startup. Any other construction or
  delivery failure is distinguishable from an ordinary cold start and follows
  R17's durable error-propagation contract.
- **R11 Control-plane replacement safety:** Stopping or killing `st2 up` must
  not stop, restart, or replace any agent it launched. st2 can be reinstalled
  and restarted while running agents continue unchanged; the replacement
  control plane adopts those existing processes by stable identity and starts
  only genuinely missing work. Stopping an agent is a separate, explicit
  lifecycle action.

### Must externalize agent state and scope

- **R08 Catalog observability:** Catalog-backed state exposes each agent's
  presence, declared activity status, current plan, and current plan step
  without PTY or transcript inspection. Presence and activity status are
  distinct, and stale state is identifiable.
- **R09 State continuity:** An agent's current work and durable decisions
  can survive process replacement without depending on its transcript.
- **R10 Agent-only identity:** st2 models agents. Non-agent identities are
  unsupported.

- **R13 Shortest-path reconciliation:** An event is evidence, not permission
  to run the world. st2 classifies source, path, kind, and affected identity,
  then takes the shortest correct path from observed state to desired state.
- **R14 Explicit filesystem-event contracts:** Every watcher is deny-by-default
  with exact roots, paths, mutation kinds, semantic meaning, debounce policy,
  and consumer. Reads, opens, unknown paths, and runtime output never trigger
  generic reconciliation.
- **R15 Bounded event coalescing:** Accepted event streams use tested
  head/tail coalescing: immediate head response, one quiet tail, and a hard
  maximum preventing starvation or unbounded scans, PTY queries, launches,
  delivery attempts, or writes.

- **R16 Supervisor declaration:** Every non-root agent declares exactly one
  supervisor; root is the only agent without a supervisor.
- **R17 Durable error propagation:** Lifecycle, harness/eval, provider-turn,
  task/exec/PTY, hook, and delivery errors are durably reported to the
  responsible supervisor with agent/task identity and actionable context.
- **R19 Targeted reconciliation:** An exact agent/task selector resolves its
  identity and pinned host before mutation; unknown, ambiguous, and wrong-host
  targets refuse before writes, listing, or actions. Materialization, hook
  gates, PTY inspection, and plan execution are limited to the selected
  owner/task; unrelated diagnostics remain visible while unrelated workspaces,
  tasks, and live PTY PID/generation stay unchanged.
  Stable IDs alone select and authorize automation; presentation values never
  resolve a message, Resource, status, lifecycle, or authoring target.
- **R20 Portable Resource bindings:** An agent may directly carry zero or more
  order-independent Resource bindings. Each binding has a non-empty, agent-local
  unique name and preserves an RFC 3986 absolute URI byte-for-byte without
  normalization. Its URI scheme is the exact lookup key for an optional,
  catalog-declared Resource Profile; scheme meaning remains downstream-owned,
  and st2 ships no built-in profiles. A registered profile may give the URI a
  contained local denotation under
  [`07-resource-profile`](07-resource-profile/requirements.md); an unregistered
  scheme stays opaque. The generic envelope itself does not imply resolution,
  access, readiness, or lifecycle semantics, and declarations that add such
  unsupported policy are rejected rather than silently ignored.
- **R21 Nondisruptive Resource observation:** Machine-readable catalog
  inspection exposes every Resource binding without interpreting its profile or URI.
  Resource-only declaration changes do not alter a task's effective launch
  definition and do not stop, replace, or relaunch healthy work.
- **R27 Transactional catalog authoring:** One st2 publication operation admits
  exactly one canonical KDL Agent Spec, with explicit host and identity, against
  the complete prospective catalog. Publication is compare-and-swap, durable,
  and atomic: readers observe either the previous declaration set or the next
  complete set. Reconciliation holds one coherent declaration snapshot through
  materialization, runtime observation, planning, and execution, so a retirement
  cannot commit and then be followed by a launch from stale catalog input.
  A durable incomplete-apply marker fences every declaration-plane snapshot and
  action after a crashed whole-catalog apply; a resident supervisor stays alive
  but performs zero lifecycle actions until the transaction is completed.
  Every successful declaration commit advances a durable monotonic catalog
  generation; whole-catalog apply advances it before its marker clears. Unlocked
  diagnostic readers therefore detect even a completed declaration ABA across
  their observation. A durable incomplete-generation intent fences readers
  across each single-writer commit and is conservatively recovered by the next
  exclusive writer. Existing-catalog writer staging exists only in the reserved
  control plane, never among authoritative declaration leaves; fresh bootstrap
  stages one non-authoritative sibling because its control plane does not exist
  yet.
  Presence, messages, context, and Resource state remain independently writable
  and are never serialized behind catalog authoring.
  A caller binds single-agent publication to the exact no-follow source capture
  with an authoritative input digest. A canonical whole-catalog snapshot
  externalizes the declaration-root digest while excluding runtime state and
  workspace content. Its closed projection includes every regular file in a
  bounded `_templates` library and exact declared canonical workspace directory
  facts. Whole-catalog apply binds its exact captured desired projection to a
  caller-supplied input digest before locking or mutation, rechecks the incumbent
  root digest under the exclusive lock, durably stages the desired bytes, and resumes
  after interruption solely from a closed marker and its content-addressed
  stage. A distinct raw-preimage projection may bind a repair to the exact
  structural declaration bytes of an invalid incumbent without interpreting
  those bytes. It has a separate hash and receipt type, refuses a strictly valid
  incumbent, admits only a fully valid prepared result, and persists its mode in
  the recovery marker. Version 1 requires one explicit external PTY root and
  rejects effective PTY-root changes. Fresh-catalog bootstrap is a distinct create transaction,
  not a catalog-apply mode: it binds an exact captured prepared projection to a
  caller-supplied digest, initializes the persistent authoring lock and first
  catalog generation before visibility, and publishes the complete catalog by
  one durable no-replace directory rename. A retry is unchanged only when the
  completed existing catalog has the exact prepared declaration root. Bootstrap
  validates and preserves one explicit external PTY root but performs no PTY
  registry I/O; process adoption and PTY-root migration remain outside its
  atomic boundary because the registry has independent producers. Apply never
  traverses, hashes, deletes, or relocates workspace or runtime state. An absent
  canonical identity becomes
  visible only as a complete bundle; a preexisting declared workspace skeleton
  remains safe because the durable marker fences declaration readers and
  marker-time state routing throughout leaf publication and verification.
  A policy-free prepared-catalog comparison takes the existing shared lock,
  binds the live side to a caller-supplied declaration-root digest, captures the
  prepared side through retained no-follow capabilities, and fully admits both
  projections before returning one versioned receipt. The receipt exposes the
  before/after declaration roots, exact added/removed/modified projected paths
  with render/template/static classification, and normalized per-agent
  Agent Spec-model field-address changes. Addresses expose only the structural
  and dynamic address keys needed to locate a field; payload values and
  per-value/agent hashes remain private. Omission and explicit defaults are
  equivalent. Comparison never
  writes live declarations, generation/marker state, runtime/state/workspace
  bytes, or the prepared source, and carries no migration policy or publication
  authority.
- **R23 Fail-closed task inventory:** One read-only machine command exposes
  every desired local PTY and exec task by agent identity, task name, runtime
  id, kind, lifecycle, retirement, desired state, runtime state, PID, creation
  time, and opaque runtime-generation id. Unknown, duplicate, malformed,
  unreadable, timed-out, PID-reused, or otherwise unprovable evidence is
  indeterminate and makes the versioned envelope incomplete and the command
  unsuccessful; it is never reported as absence. The command projects a
  supervisor's known park fault and per-task recovery action alongside the
  unmodified runtime observation. The action is structured executable argv
  carrying the exact canonical catalog folder and selected host, so invoking it
  never falls back to ambient catalog or host defaults. A believable park
  remains complete, while an unbelievable park marker fails closed like other
  unprovable evidence.
  Observation detects semantic declaration drift across its runtime probe,
  does not invoke a backend for a root positively absent at admission, and
  performs no reconciliation, cleanup, lifecycle change, or state rewrite. An
  admitted PTY root that changes
  filesystem identity during the backend probe makes the observation
  incomplete; the external backend may already have recreated a concurrently
  removed registry. This diagnostic boundary is not transactionally serialized
  with catalog or runtime writers and is not control-plane cutover authority.
  It samples the durable catalog generation and incomplete marker around
  discovery and runtime observation; any marker, malformed fence, or generation
  change makes the envelope incomplete.
- **R24 Stable identity and bounded presentation:** The positional Agent Spec
  identity and its host-qualified bus identity remain the sole stable keys for
  routing, ownership, adoption, lifecycle, and automation. Agent Specs may
  declare optional, non-empty `name` and `description` strings in canonical KDL
  and the readable TOML/JSON forms. `name` is a non-unique mutable human label,
  limited to 160 Unicode scalars; `description` is an enduring responsibility
  boundary, limited to 1,000. Both are single-line: Cc control characters and
  U+2028/U+2029 are invalid. Omission means absence. Presentation is never an
  alias, and the declaration is its sole source of truth; a sibling `name` file
  is ignored without migration or compatibility behavior.
- **R25 Constrained presentation authoring:** `st2 rename` and `st2 describe`
  set or clear only their corresponding direct field in one canonical KDL
  declaration selected by stable identity. They preserve unrelated source
  bytes, serialize cooperating local writers through the persistent shared
  `.st2/catalog-authoring.lock`, reject a stale source before atomic
  replacement, fsync the result, and return classified receipts. The lock inode
  is never removed or stale-recovered and defines one local POSIX
  filesystem/kernel exclusion domain; it is not cross-host coordination or OS
  isolation from direct external writers. TOML, JSON, declarations explicitly
  marked Nix-owned, stable-ID changes, and malformed or ambiguous targets fail
  closed. Nix emitters must publish that marker before authoring is activated.
  In the trusted-fleet model, caller-supplied `ST_AGENT` provides a guardrail,
  not authentication: a catalog agent may edit itself or a descendant reached
  through declared supervisor edges, while its absence selects the operator
  path.
- **R26 Nondisruptive Agent Spec presentation projection:** For every healthy
  managed PTY, st2 reconciles a versioned owned tag snapshot containing the
  stable actor identity plus optional description through one exact task-ID
  metadata patch. The primary
  `agent` task additionally maps optional name to native PTY display metadata;
  secondary PTYs preserve their task-specific display convention. Projection
  preserves unrelated tags, removes absent owned values, reports and retries
  failure, and is idempotent. It never uses display-name resolution or enters
  launch, teardown, garbage collection, replacement, or flapping accounting.
  The current lowered Agent Spec remains the only source of `name` and `description`;
  harness consumers may read one exact qualified identity through
  `st2 agents --identity <host>.<identity> --json`. st2 publishes no duplicate
  Agent Spec presentation state file.
- **R27 Typed agent desired state:** Every admitted Agent Spec has exactly one
  whole-agent desired state: `running`, `suspended`, or `retired`. Omission and
  legacy `retired #false` mean running; legacy `retired #true` means retired
  without a rationale. New suspended and retired declarations require one
  valid human rationale of 1..160 UTF-8 bytes. Running forbids a rationale, and
  a declaration that mixes legacy `retired` with `desired-state` is invalid.
  Running uses ordinary task reconciliation. Suspended and retired agents do
  not launch or materialize tasks and tear down every live owned task,
  including generated companions. Suspension preserves the declaration,
  inbox, context, resources, and existing `keep` and `adopt-only` policy; resume
  grants no replacement authority beyond ordinary reconciliation. Retirement
  retains its stronger collection contract.
- **R28 Desired-state authoring and observation:** `st2 agent desired-state`
  changes lifecycle intent only in one canonical KDL declaration selected by
  stable identity. It uses the same source-preserving, durable, serialized,
  exact-target, trusted-fleet authority boundary as presentation authoring and
  refuses Nix-owned, malformed, ambiguous, or unsupported declarations.
  Running is canonically omitted; suspended and retired states persist their
  rationale. Its receipt proves the declaration edit, never runtime
  convergence. Human listing, roster JSON, task inventory, and Doctor expose
  desired state without conflating it with presence or observed liveness.
- **R29 Visible, nondisruptive launch drift:** st2 derives a versioned desired
  launch fingerprint from the minimal effective fields it already passes to a
  task. Only an st2 launch records an observed fingerprint, bound to that
  launch's exact runtime identity and creation incarnation. A missing or
  mismatched binding reports `unknown`; otherwise inspection reports
  `converged` or `drifted`. Healthy `drifted` and `unknown` tasks are adopted
  without implicit restart.
- **R30 Explicit replacement boundary:** An absent or dead active task launches
  from the latest current declaration. Retirement stops live work and prevents
  relaunch. Replacing live work is a separate, explicitly selected operation
  fenced by catalog, host, effective PTY root, task set, and an exact runtime
  identity recheck immediately before disruption. Renaming remains
  retire-old/add-new. Every behavior remains complete with an ordinary catalog
  folder and without CAS, captured generations, or replacement journals.
