# Deployment summary plan

Read `inventory.json` and produce `RESULT.md`.

The result must contain this information:

- The service count.
- The total replica count.
- The public service names in alphabetical order.
- The owner names in alphabetical order without duplicates.

Use exactly these four line labels. Replace each placeholder with the computed value.

```text
Services: COUNT
Total replicas: COUNT
Public services: NAMES
Owners: NAMES
```

Do not add a heading, list markers, or other lines.

Run `bash verify.sh` after you write the result. Correct the result until the verifier passes.

Before you inspect `inventory.json` or write `RESULT.md`, publish the complete execution plan to st3.
Publish one ready plan with ID `eval/plan-document-lift/work`.

The KDL file must start with `version 2`. It must put the plan inside one untyped `subgraph` root.

The published plan must contain these ordered steps:

1. `inspect-inventory` reads and classifies the input.
2. `write-result` depends on `inspect-inventory` and writes `RESULT.md`.
3. `verify-result` depends on `write-result` and runs `bash verify.sh`.
4. `publish-result` depends on `verify-result` and publishes the result resource.

Give each step a clear title and goal. Keep the work in graph state instead of model memory.

The final step must declare this graph product:

```kdl
produces {
  resource "${ROOT_ST_PLAN_RUN}/plan-result" {
    kind "document.result"
    state "published"
  }
}
```

Its goal must tell the worker to run this exact command after the verifier passes:

```sh
st3 claim resource/${ROOT_ST_PLAN_RUN}/plan-result resource.binding --field kind=document.result --field state=published
```
