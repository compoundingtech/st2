# st2

st2 runs a declarative network of Codex and Claude agents from one catalog. It owns process
reconciliation, native messages, normalized terminal DING delivery, presence, durable context,
workspace materialization, and explicit teardown.

Hand-authored KDL is the canonical interface. `st2 compile-agent` is experimental and must be
reviewed before its output is materialized.

## Product intent and implementation contract

Read the [vision](docs/vrs/vision.md), [requirements](docs/vrs/requirements.md), and
[specification](docs/vrs/spec.md) before changing product behavior. Update `docs/vrs/spec.md` with
implementation changes. Nathan must approve changes to `docs/vrs/vision.md` or
`docs/vrs/requirements.md`.

## Install

Prerequisites:

- Rust and Cargo;
- `pty` on `PATH`;
- at least one supported harness on `PATH`: `codex` or `claude`;
- Git when a declaration materializes workspace files;
- Bash and `jq` on `PATH` when lifecycle hooks are enabled.

From a checkout:

```sh
cargo install --path . --locked
st2 --help
pty --help
st2 hooks install
st2 hooks verify
```

The standard catalog is:

```text
${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/st2/default/catalog
```

Every catalog-aware command accepts `--catalog`; otherwise st2 uses `$CATALOG`, then that standard
location.

### A catalog may declare its session registry

A catalog's tasks live in `<catalog>/pty` unless the catalog says otherwise. To put several catalogs
in one host-wide `pty` registry — so any viewer enumerates every session without knowing which
catalog produced it — declare it in `<catalog>/catalog.kdl`:

```kdl
catalog {
  pty-root "/run/agents/pty"
}
```

`pty-root` accepts `$VAR`/`$CATALOG`; a relative value anchors at the catalog root. The resolution
order is an exported `PTY_ROOT` (a deliberate override, used by `st2 eval` for a short socket path),
then this declaration, then `<catalog>/pty`. A catalog that declares nothing is unaffected.

Prefer the declaration over exporting `PTY_ROOT` into readers: a reader that misses the export
resolves a different registry and reports live agents as dead. When adopting it on a host whose
systemd unit was installed with an ambient `PTY_ROOT`, reinstall the unit without one
(`st2 service install`) — the export still wins, and leaving it pins the supervisor to the old
registry while everything else follows the catalog.

Lifecycle hooks are installed only by the explicit `st2 hooks install` command. The installer
publishes an immutable content-addressed set, then atomically selects it with a receipt. `st2 up`
verifies its own immutable set for Codex launches; any local workspace render that actually
references `$ST_HOOKS` verifies that set before writing. Selecting a successor does not invalidate
an older running binary's installed set during cutover. Hook-free materialization does not require
an installed set. These checks never create, refresh, or rewrite hooks. To select this binary's
exact hook set when the installed and candidate builds are older or cannot be ordered, use `st2
hooks install --replace`. `st2 hooks verify-own` is the read-only cutover probe for an installed
binary that may no longer be selected.

`ST_HOOKS` overrides the machine-local hook root for installation, verification, and managed tasks.
During materialization, hook commands such as `$ST_HOOKS/codex-stop.sh` resolve to the invoking
binary's immutable set, so rendered settings are versioned without embedding a machine-specific
root in the declaration.

The hooks have a small operational purpose: session-start restores durable context and exposes the
current inbox; pre-compact preserves a recovery breadcrumb when no context was written; stop and
failure hooks surface newly arrived work or a harness failure. They fail open so hook trouble does
not prevent the harness from starting or stopping.

## Author a native agent

Start from the maintained [Codex](examples/native/agent-codex.kdl) or
[Claude](examples/native/agent-claude.kdl) declaration:

```sh
export CATALOG="${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/st2/default/catalog"
mkdir -p "$CATALOG/agents/<host>/<identity>" "$CATALOG/_templates"
cp examples/native/agent-codex.kdl "$CATALOG/agents/<host>/<identity>/agent.kdl"
${EDITOR:-vi} "$CATALOG/agents/<host>/<identity>/agent.kdl"
```

Replace `<host>`, `<identity>`, `<workspace>`, and `<boot prompt>`. Add every file referenced by
`copy` under `$CATALOG/_templates`.

The compact declaration shape is:

```kdl
agent "<identity>" {
  host "<host>"
  workspace "<workspace>"
  resource "work" _tag="github-issue" uri="github-issue://example/project/123"
  // Optional metadata:
  // role "worker"
  // supervisor "<supervisor-bus-id>"
  env { ST_AGENT "<host>.<identity>" }
  argv "codex" "--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox" "--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust" "<boot prompt>"
  ding

  render {
    copy "_templates/<host>.<identity>.AGENTS.md" "AGENTS.md"
    json-upsert ".codex/hooks.json" #"""
{"hooks":{"SessionStart":[{"hooks":[{"type":"command","command":"$ST_HOOKS/codex-session-start.sh","timeout":5}]}]}}
"""#
    git-exclude "AGENTS.md" ".codex/hooks.json"
  }
}
```

For a zero-interruption migration, add `lifecycle "adopt-only"` to the compact
agent or to an explicit `pty`/`exec` task. st2 adopts that task when its current
generation is alive. If the generation is dead or absent, st2 reports the task
as `held` and does not remove or launch anything:

```kdl
agent "<identity>" {
  host "<host>"
  workspace "<workspace>"
  lifecycle "adopt-only"
  argv "codex" "<boot prompt>"
}
```

This is a fence, not a restart policy. After inspecting or recovering the
original generation, deliberately change the lifecycle back to `"service"` (or
remove the field) to authorize ordinary absent launch and dead replacement.
`retired #true` remains an explicit teardown instruction and takes precedence.

`resource` binds an agent-local semantic name to an exact RFC 3986 absolute URI. `_tag` selects a
concrete resource contract understood by downstream readers; st2 preserves arbitrary non-empty tags
and URI bytes without normalization. It neither owns their schemas nor resolves their targets.
Binding order is irrelevant and names must be unique within the agent:

```kdl
resource "work" _tag="github-issue" uri="github-issue://example/project/123"
resource "source" _tag="worktree" uri="worktree://github.com/example/project/change"
resource "delivery" _tag="ding" uri="ding://host/agent"
```

The envelope is intentionally only `name` + `_tag` + `uri`. It carries no required/optional,
access, readiness, or lifecycle policy, and URI possession conveys no authority. Resource-only
declaration edits do not stop, replace, or relaunch a live task. Resource types and resolvers remain
opaque to st2; catalog readers use the public `agent-spec` crate to inspect the typed bindings.

`argv` launches its first value directly with the remaining values as arguments. It resolves a bare
program such as `codex` through the task environment's `PATH`, preserves argument boundaries, and
does not introduce a shell. Use `command #"..."#` instead when the task intentionally needs shell
syntax such as pipelines, redirects, or variable expansion; `command` continues to run under
`sh -c`. A runnable task must declare exactly one of `argv` or `command`.

### Scheduled work is coming soon, not implemented

st2 does not parse or run scheduled entries today. The intended direction starts with a declarative
DING targeted at the containing agent; scheduled PTY or exec work may be considered later. This is a
non-functional preview, and `st2 validate` correctly rejects it today:

```kdl
agent "<identity>" {
  // Current implemented fields and tasks go here.

  // FUTURE ONLY — reserved and rejected by the current contract.
  schedule "local-health" {
    every "2h"
    ding "Run the local health check."
  }
}
```

st2 provides `CATALOG`, flat native `ST_ROOT`, local `PTY_ROOT`, `ST_AGENT`, and `ST_HOOKS` to the
task. The complete st2-managed overlay is also persisted in PTY metadata, so a manual `pty restart`
retains those values. Declarations should not contain machine-specific install paths.

## Validate and materialize

Gate the declaration before starting anything:

```sh
st2 hooks verify
st2 validate --catalog "$CATALOG" --strict
st2 up --catalog "$CATALOG" --host <host> --materialize-only
```

Validation always checks the whole synced catalog structurally. External workspace and task-path
presence is checked only for the selected run host, which defaults to the local short hostname; use
`--host <host>` to validate another machine's local paths. Supervisors may be declared as either a
bare identity or the fully-qualified `<host>.<identity>` bus id.

Materialization simulates all content operations before writing. It refuses any real change to a
Git-tracked target, including `AGENTS.md`; byte-identical tracked content is accepted. Inspect the
declared targets and keep generated overlays untracked. Detection invokes `git` and fails closed if
the executable is unavailable or a workspace that appears to be a worktree cannot be inspected.

`git-exclude` is advisory. `copy`, `file`, `json-upsert`, and `ensure-line` are boot-gating.

## Run

On headless Linux, install the systemd user service:

```sh
st2 service install --catalog "$CATALOG" --host <host>
st2 service status
```

Each task runs in its own transient scope, so restarting the supervisor does not kill live agents.

On macOS, use a manual one-shot reconcile:

```sh
st2 up --catalog "$CATALOG" --host <host> --once
```

There is intentionally no resident macOS service path.

For a shortest-path change to one exact task, render only its owning agent and reconcile only that
task in a bounded pass:

```sh
st2 up --catalog "$CATALOG" --host <host> --once --task <host.agent.task>
```

Unknown, ambiguous, and wrong-host task selectors refuse before workspace writes or PTY inspection.

`st2 doctor` accepts the absence of a live host lock as the normal manual/`--once` mode. For a
resident `st2 up` deployment, use `st2 doctor --require-supervisor` to make a missing loop fail the
health check. A stale lock left by a dead supervisor is always a failure. The underlying
non-interactive `pty list --json` runtime probe is bounded; a wedged client becomes an explicit
doctor failure instead of hanging the health check. Its short outer deadline is containment for a
wedged runtime, not a fleet-scalability mechanism.

For a foreground supervisor on any host:

```sh
st2 up --catalog "$CATALOG" --host <host>
```

### Typed task inventory (diagnostic only)

Use the typed inventory instead of parsing `doctor` prose:

```sh
st2 tasks --catalog "$CATALOG" --host <host> --json
```

The `st2.task-inventory.v1` envelope joins the selected host's desired PTY and exec tasks to
read-only runtime evidence. A complete observation exits zero. Catalog parse errors, declaration
drift during observation, duplicate runtime IDs, timeouts, malformed output, PID reuse, and
otherwise unprovable generations emit `complete: false` and exit non-zero. Missing runtime rows
become `absent` only when the corresponding backend observation is complete; uncertainty remains
`indeterminate`.

A PTY root positively absent at admission is not passed to `pty` and remains absent; an absent exec
state root likewise remains absent. If an admitted PTY root is concurrently removed, the result is
incomplete because its filesystem identity changed, but the external `pty list` implementation may
recreate its registry before st2 can detect the race. Observation never rewrites an existing exec PID
record. It also does not serialize catalog or runtime writers, reconcile tasks, or authorize a
control-plane cutover. Consumers that require a zero-write boundary under concurrent root deletion
or a transactional declaration boundary need a separate protocol.

### Staged control-plane replacement gate

`st2 up` is a replaceable control plane, not the lifetime owner of an agent. Stopping it normally
or killing it must leave every agent running. `st2 down` and declaration retirement are separate,
explicit lifecycle actions and must never be used merely to replace the control plane.

Every staged recovery or binary cutover must retain a pre-stop receipt of each agent's stable task
identity, PID, and process-creation identity. Install the verified replacement binary atomically
while those tasks continue running, restart the control plane, and do not accept the host until its
first reconcile proves all of the following:

- every pre-existing agent is still usable with the same PID and creation identity;
- the replacement reports those agents as adopted and does not launch or duplicate them;
- only genuinely missing declared work is launched;
- explicit teardown remains the only path that stops an agent.

The executable gate drives the real st2 binary and both PTY and exec backends through normal stop,
forced kill, atomic binary replacement, adoption, a live-task heartbeat, and a duplicate-boot
receipt:

```sh
cargo test --test nomad_survival --all-features
```

## Messages, DING, status, and context

Inside a managed task, `CATALOG`, `ST_ROOT`, and `ST_AGENT` are already set:

```sh
st2 status "$ST_AGENT" --set available
st2 message send <recipient> --subject "work" -m "Please handle the scoped task."
st2 message ls
st2 message read <filename>
st2 message reply <filename> -m "Handled."
st2 message archive <filename>
st2 agents --json --enrich
st2 agent name <host.identity> "Display name"
st2 agent name <host.identity> --clear
st2 context read --full
```

The roster includes retired declarations instead of silently conflating them with runtime
presence. Both JSON shapes contain `retired` and the declaration's ordered `resources` descriptors;
`--enrich` additionally supplies `lastActivity` and `inbox`. Human output leaves active rows
unchanged and appends `[retired]` to a retired row.

`st2 agent name` changes only the optional `<agent-dir>/name` presentation file. It resolves the
Agent Spec's declared identity instead of trusting folder spelling, refuses missing or ambiguous
targets, and reports changed/unchanged/error receipts with `--json`. Setting or clearing a display
name never changes the bus identity or task ID, reconciles work, or restarts a running task.
Qualified remote and retired declarations remain authorable because this metadata has no runtime
authority.

For a catalog-backed agent, every native bus operation resolves the same agent directory used by
the roster: presence is `<agent-dir>/status`, while unread messages, archive receipts, context, and
links live under `<agent-dir>/resources/`. The flat `<root>/<identity>` layout remains only as the
intentional catalog-less fallback used by isolated folder evals. In a catalog-backed root,
`st2 message ls` rejects an absent identity; recovery inspection of a deliberately orphaned flat
box must be explicit with `st2 message ls <identity> --orphan` (and optionally `--archive`).

Adopters should cut directly to the native layout. Before launching a migrated identity, install and
verify hooks, validate and materialize its hand-authored declaration, stop any predecessor transport,
and decide how any unread predecessor backlog will be archived or forwarded. Never run predecessor
and native DING owners concurrently for the same identity.

Native DING watches the recipient inbox and delivers a normalized notice:

```text
[DING] new st2 message: [id:<rand6>] <subject> (from <sender>); check your inbox
```

Consumers must key on the `[DING]` prefix and stable id, not descriptive words. Every maintained
harness uses the same transport: normalize untrusted fields into bounded, single-line printable
text, positively identify an empty current Codex or Claude composer, and send one bracketed-paste
sequence without Return. The sidecar then observes for a short bounded window and sends a separate
bare Return only after two immediately adjacent inspections show the exact notice in a positively
idle composer. A human draft, active turn, modal, changed composer, unreadable screen, command
timeout, or unknown renderer defers submission. Once a paste command starts, the sidecar retains
ownership and retries by inspection only, so a timeout cannot duplicate the paste. This measured
screen heuristic is fail-closed for the maintained renderer versions but is not an evented TUI
contract; renderer changes can defer delivery and remain an explicit design gap.

Agents must declare `busy` before actively executing work and return to `available` only when
yielding or ready for new work, but `busy` never suppresses DING. Fresh `dnd` is the only delivery
hold. The sidecar does not refresh `dnd`, so an abandoned hold becomes stale after 15 minutes and
delivery resumes. New arrivals remain FIFO, same-filename archive receipts shadow and clean restored
inbox duplicates, and failed or uncertain PTY operations retain the notice for safe retry. Unsafe
delivery retries use a bounded backoff, so an active composer cannot make the sidecar spawn a fresh
PTY probe on every inbox poll. On start
or restart, the sidecar first adopts an exact staged recovery/backlog notice when present, then sends
one generic check-inbox recovery DING if unread work remains; it does not replay every backlog
message.

Both DING and the catalog supervisor use filesystem events only as an early-wake optimization.
Create, modify, rename, and remove events wake them; read/open access events do not. Their own inbox
and catalog reads therefore cannot self-trigger a Linux inotify loop, and the bounded timer remains
the correctness fallback.

## Cleanup

Explicit teardown is the only operation that ends declared tasks:

```sh
st2 down --catalog "$CATALOG" --host <host>
```

On Linux, remove the supervisor service after teardown when it is no longer wanted:

```sh
st2 service uninstall
```

## Command surface

```text
ls, up, down, validate, doctor
message, ding, agents, status, context, resource
env, pty, shell, pretrust
hooks, service, eval
compile-agent (experimental)
completions
```

`st2 completions <shell>` emits completions from the live command tree. No generated completion or
manpage tree is committed.

## Clean-room verification

The test suite builds a temporary `PATH` containing only the current `st2` binary, required Git,
and `pty`, `codex`, and `claude` shims. It installs and verifies a scratch hook receipt, instantiates
both maintained hand-authored KDL examples in fresh Git workspaces, validates and materializes them
twice, and verifies the help/doctor/native authoring surface without a predecessor transport binary:

```sh
cargo test --test native_only --all-features
```

Run the complete local gate with:

```sh
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-targets --all-features
```

## Eval contract

The sole canonical agent contract is
[`AGENT-SPEC.md`](https://github.com/compoundingtech/evals/blob/main/AGENT-SPEC.md) in the evals
repository. Eval corpus definitions, execution/readiness evidence, authorization, and results belong
to that repository; st2 does not duplicate or pin its ledgers here.

An eval that exercises production Agent Specs opts in explicitly:

```kdl
eval {
  copy "./fixture"
  run "publish-canonical-team" { command "..." }
  canonical-agents
  message { from "requester"; to "evalhost.supervisor"; content "./task.md" }
  max-timeout "300s"
  judges { /* held-out checks */ }
}
```

`copy` and deterministic `run` steps populate the hermetic temporary catalog first.
`canonical-agents` then recursively discovers the catalog and projects declarations resolved to the
eval host. Explicit `identity` and `host` fields remain authoritative independent of organizational
placement; each declaration parent remains its native state/resource anchor. The directive is
mutually exclusive with compact `team` / `agent` declarations, so the local Agent Spec vector is the
sole authority for launch, kickoff routing, supervision, logs, and teardown. Strict catalog
validation, fleet-unique nonempty task runtime IDs, and warning-free local materialization all finish
before an agent task starts; backend launch errors are fatal. Remote-host declarations remain inert.
Native inbox/archive paths are frozen from the admitted local vector, so later catalog mutation
cannot redirect eval traffic. A multi-agent team completes only after the existing worker-report ordering.
For a singleton, the requester inbox is snapshotted before kickoff; only a newly appearing
interviewer reply at-or-after the exact kickoff receipt completes it. Canonical completion gates the
verdict. Without the directive, Agent Spec-shaped files inside a fixture remain inert and compact
evals retain their flat bus and completion semantics.

`st2 compile-agent` remains experimental. Hand-authored KDL is the canonical st2 authoring
interface, and generated output must be reviewed before materialization.
