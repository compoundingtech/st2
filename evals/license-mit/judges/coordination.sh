# JUDGE: coordination — the full team loop is visible on the bus, and the confirmation is VERIFIED (not a bare ack).
#
# The loop must show, on the st2 bus:
#   (1) a supervisor -> worker delegation,
#   (2) a worker -> supervisor report, and
#   (3) a supervisor -> requester confirmation that POST-DATES the worker's report — i.e. the sup confirmed
#       AFTER the work came back, not just the initial "on it, will confirm" ack it fires right after the kick.
# A completed change with no worker->sup report is the signature of out-of-band / sup-did-it-itself work.
#
# PASS (exit 0): all three are present, with (3) later than the oldest report.
#
# st2 starts this judge after the supervisor closes the loop. st3 can start it as soon as the
# checkpoint graph is ready. The judge therefore waits for the causal loop instead of taking one
# early snapshot. Under st3, each poll refreshes the read-only file projection from the API.
