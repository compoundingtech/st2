//! Canonical durable state for native message delivery.
//!
//! The ledger records one monotone evidence chain per inbox filename. Drivers translate their
//! harness-specific observations into [`Evidence`]; this module owns persistence, phase grading,
//! retry authorization, and binding isolation. Inbox archive remains the recipient's settlement
//! authority and is reconciled through [`Ledger::prune`].
//!
//! One phase can reach this ledger without this build observing anything: an attempt an earlier
//! release made and left behind. [`Attestation`] is the whole vocabulary for that — an asserted
//! phase bounds what already happened, so it suppresses a duplicate, and it is not evidence, so
//! it authorizes no transport. The translation itself lives outside this module, behind the one
//! seam in [`Ledger::open`].
