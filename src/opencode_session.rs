//! Controlled OpenCode launch: presence, observed harness state, and native server delivery.
//!
//! OpenCode's interactive TUI is also a server: the wrapper allocates a loopback port and a
//! per-seat password, launches the TUI bound to them, and speaks plain HTTP to its own child. Two
//! consumers hang off that surface. The observed-state producer subscribes to the `/event` SSE
//! stream and projects session status, permission asks, and questions into the generic
//! `harness-state` record — evidence-gated, so a dropped stream stops the heartbeat and the record
//! ages out rather than restating a state nobody is watching. The delivery pump mirrors the Codex
//! FIFO discipline through the shared [`crate::delivery_ledger`]: an `attempted` entry is durable
//! before transport, the transport is `POST /session/<id>/prompt_async` with a caller-derived
//! stable `messageID`, and the only receipt this transport can produce is the message read back
//! from the server — never the `/tui/*` endpoints, which acknowledge input even when no TUI is
//! attached. That read-back is graded as `persisted`, because it proves the server STORED the
//! message and says nothing about the session scheduler admitting it; persistence therefore holds
//! the inbox entry rather than releasing it, and is never mistaken for consumption.
//!
//! Fail-closed gate: delivery requires both a supported `opencode --version` and a live `/doc`
//! subset check proving the exact API arms st2 depends on. Observation requires only the `/doc`
//! check — its vocabulary already degrades to indeterminate on anything unrecognized.

///   pulled on demand and cached per `providerID/modelID`. While it is unknown both the window and
///   the percent are withheld (HC-R02), never guessed from a model table.
