//! Move retired, runtime-free identities out of the live declaration plane.
//!
//! `retired` is runtime teardown only: the declaration and its `resources/` stay byte-identical and
//! reversible. Archival is the pressure valve that keeps the live catalog bounded. An archived
//! identity's whole directory is moved under the catalog control plane, where `.st2` is already
//! excluded at any depth by discovery, validation, and the whole-catalog transaction — so an
//! archived spec is structurally undiscoverable rather than merely filtered. A tombstone beside the
//! moved directory keeps the identity traceable in `st2 catalog graph --json`, and
//! `st2 catalog unarchive` is the exact reverse move.
//!
//! Both moves run under the catalog's exclusive authoring lock and inside one generation commit,
//! and both are same-filesystem renames by construction: the archive root is a child of the catalog
//! root, so there is no copy engine and no partially copied bundle to reason about.
