//! Durable, bounded diagnostics published by native driver cores.
//!
//! A driver owns one current record per agent. Internally the publisher retains one failure per
//! stage and projects the earliest failing stage, so a later transport symptom cannot hide an
//! unresolved admission failure. Recovering a stage clears only that stage and immediately reveals
//! the next outstanding failure; recovering the final stage removes the record.
