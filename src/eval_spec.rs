//! The **st2 spec** — the native, legible eval/agent format (`st2 eval ./folder`), nailed down in
//! review. One `.kdl` file describes a team
//! and (optionally) an `eval` that copies a fixture, kicks off the team, waits for the sup's
//! confirmation, and runs judges. This module is the PARSER + model (P1); `st2 up`/`st2 eval` (team
//! boot + eval flow + judge engine) build on it.
//!
//! Principles (from the design — do not violate): legible top-to-bottom, everything in one file, st2
//! self-contained (`st2 ding`, only `pty` on PATH). Ergonomic collapses (review-driven): a bare `ding`
//! node is the built-in sidecar (auto-prefixed `team.agent.ding`, `--root $ST_ROOT`) — dedicated, so
//! `exec` reserves no magic name; `exec`/custom labels auto-prefix to `team.agent.<leaf>`. `ST_AGENT`
//! stays author-set for now (its auto-derive is provided as a unit-tested helper). (`ding` → `ping` later.)
