# st2

st2 runs a declarative network of Codex and Claude agents from one catalog. It owns process
reconciliation, native messages, normalized terminal DING delivery, presence, durable context,
workspace materialization, and explicit teardown.

Hand-authored KDL is the canonical interface. `st2 compile-agent` is experimental and must be
reviewed before its output is materialized.

## Product intent and implementation contract

Read the [vision](docs/vrs/vision.md), [requirements](docs/vrs/requirements.md), and
[specification](docs/vrs/spec.md) before changing product behavior. Update `docs/vrs/spec.md` with
implementation changes. Nathan must approve changes to `docs/vrs/vision.md` or
`docs/vrs/requirements.md`.

## Install

Prerequisites:

- Rust and Cargo;
- `pty` on `PATH`;
- at least one supported harness on `PATH`: `codex` or `claude`;
- Git when a declaration materializes workspace files.

From a checkout:

```sh
cargo install --path . --locked
st2 --help
pty --help
st2 hooks install
st2 hooks verify
```

The standard catalog is:

```text
${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/st2/default/catalog
```

Every catalog-aware command accepts `--catalog`; otherwise st2 uses `$CATALOG`, then that standard
location.

Lifecycle hooks are installed only by the explicit `st2 hooks install` command. The installer
publishes an immutable content-addressed set, then atomically selects it with a receipt. `st2 up`
verifies that receipt for Codex launches; any local workspace render that actually references
`$ST_HOOKS` verifies it before writing. Hook-free materialization does not require an installed
set. These checks never create, refresh, or rewrite hooks. An intentional rollback to an older set
requires `st2 hooks install --allow-downgrade`.

`ST_HOOKS` overrides the machine-local hook root for installation, verification, and managed tasks.
During materialization, hook commands such as `$ST_HOOKS/codex-stop.sh` resolve to the selected
immutable set, so rendered settings are versioned without embedding a machine-specific root in the
declaration.

The hooks have a small operational purpose: session-start restores durable context and exposes the
current inbox; pre-compact preserves a recovery breadcrumb when no context was written; stop and
failure hooks surface newly arrived work or a harness failure. They fail open so hook trouble does
not prevent the harness from starting or stopping.

## Author a native agent

Start from the maintained [Codex](examples/native/agent-codex.kdl) or
[Claude](examples/native/agent-claude.kdl) declaration:

```sh
export CATALOG="${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/st2/default/catalog"
mkdir -p "$CATALOG/agents/<host>/<identity>" "$CATALOG/_templates"
cp examples/native/agent-codex.kdl "$CATALOG/agents/<host>/<identity>/agent.kdl"
${EDITOR:-vi} "$CATALOG/agents/<host>/<identity>/agent.kdl"
```

Replace `<host>`, `<identity>`, `<workspace>`, and `<boot prompt>`. Add every file referenced by
`copy` under `$CATALOG/_templates`.

The compact declaration shape is:

```kdl
agent "<identity>" {
  host "<host>"
  workspace "<workspace>"
  // Optional metadata:
  // role "worker"
  // supervisor "<supervisor-bus-id>"
  env { ST_AGENT "<host>.<identity>" }
  command #"exec codex --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust '<boot prompt>'"#
  ding

  render {
    copy "_templates/<host>.<identity>.AGENTS.md" "AGENTS.md"
    json-upsert ".codex/hooks.json" #"""
{"hooks":{"SessionStart":[{"hooks":[{"type":"command","command":"$ST_HOOKS/codex-session-start.sh","timeout":5}]}]}}
"""#
    git-exclude "AGENTS.md" ".codex/hooks.json"
  }
}
```

### Scheduled work is coming soon, not implemented

st2 does not parse or run scheduled entries today. The intended direction starts with a declarative
DING targeted at the containing agent; scheduled PTY or exec work may be considered later. This is a
non-functional preview, and `st2 validate` correctly rejects it today:

```kdl
agent "<identity>" {
  // Current implemented fields and tasks go here.

  // FUTURE ONLY — reserved and rejected by the current contract.
  schedule "local-health" {
    every "2h"
    ding "Run the local health check."
  }
}
```

st2 provides `CATALOG`, flat native `ST_ROOT`, local `PTY_ROOT`, `ST_AGENT`, and `ST_HOOKS` to the
task. The complete st2-managed overlay is also persisted in PTY metadata, so a manual `pty restart`
retains those values. Declarations should not contain machine-specific install paths.

## Validate and materialize

Gate the declaration before starting anything:

```sh
st2 hooks verify
st2 validate --catalog "$CATALOG" --strict
st2 up --catalog "$CATALOG" --host <host> --materialize-only
```

Validation always checks the whole synced catalog structurally. External workspace and task-path
presence is checked only for the selected run host, which defaults to the local short hostname; use
`--host <host>` to validate another machine's local paths. Supervisors may be declared as either a
bare identity or the fully-qualified `<host>.<identity>` bus id.

Materialization simulates all content operations before writing. It refuses any real change to a
Git-tracked target, including `AGENTS.md`; byte-identical tracked content is accepted. Inspect the
declared targets and keep generated overlays untracked. Detection invokes `git` and fails closed if
the executable is unavailable or a workspace that appears to be a worktree cannot be inspected.

`git-exclude` is advisory. `copy`, `file`, `json-upsert`, and `ensure-line` are boot-gating.

## Run

On headless Linux, install the systemd user service:

```sh
st2 service install --catalog "$CATALOG" --host <host>
st2 service status
```

Each task runs in its own transient scope, so restarting the supervisor does not kill live agents.

On macOS, use a manual one-shot reconcile:

```sh
st2 up --catalog "$CATALOG" --host <host> --once
```

There is intentionally no resident macOS service path.

`st2 doctor` accepts the absence of a live host lock as the normal manual/`--once` mode. For a
resident `st2 up` deployment, use `st2 doctor --require-supervisor` to make a missing loop fail the
health check. A stale lock left by a dead supervisor is always a failure. The underlying
non-interactive `pty list --json` runtime probe is bounded; a wedged client becomes an explicit
doctor failure instead of hanging the health check.

For a foreground supervisor on any host:

```sh
st2 up --catalog "$CATALOG" --host <host>
```

### Staged control-plane replacement gate

`st2 up` is a replaceable control plane, not the lifetime owner of an agent. Stopping it normally
or killing it must leave every agent running. `st2 down` and declaration retirement are separate,
explicit lifecycle actions and must never be used merely to replace the control plane.

Every staged recovery or binary cutover must retain a pre-stop receipt of each agent's stable task
identity, PID, and process-creation identity. Install the verified replacement binary atomically
while those tasks continue running, restart the control plane, and do not accept the host until its
first reconcile proves all of the following:

- every pre-existing agent is still usable with the same PID and creation identity;
- the replacement reports those agents as adopted and does not launch or duplicate them;
- only genuinely missing declared work is launched;
- explicit teardown remains the only path that stops an agent.

The executable gate drives the real st2 binary and both PTY and exec backends through normal stop,
forced kill, atomic binary replacement, adoption, a live-task heartbeat, and a duplicate-boot
receipt:

```sh
cargo test --test nomad_survival --all-features
```

## Messages, DING, status, and context

Inside a managed task, `CATALOG`, `ST_ROOT`, and `ST_AGENT` are already set:

```sh
st2 status "$ST_AGENT" --set available
st2 message send <recipient> --subject "work" -m "Please handle the scoped task."
st2 message ls
st2 message read <filename>
st2 message reply <filename> -m "Handled."
st2 message archive <filename>
st2 agents --json --enrich
st2 context read --full
```

The roster includes retired declarations instead of silently conflating them with runtime
presence. Both JSON shapes contain an additive `retired` boolean; `--enrich` additionally supplies
`lastActivity` and `inbox`. Human output leaves active rows unchanged and appends `[retired]` to a
retired row.

For a catalog-backed agent, every native bus operation resolves the same agent directory used by
the roster: presence is `<agent-dir>/status`, while unread messages, archive receipts, context, and
links live under `<agent-dir>/resources/`. The flat `<root>/<identity>` layout remains only as the
intentional catalog-less fallback used by isolated folder evals.

Adopters should cut directly to the native layout. Before launching a migrated identity, install and
verify hooks, validate and materialize its hand-authored declaration, stop any predecessor transport,
and decide how any unread predecessor backlog will be archived or forwarded. Never run predecessor
and native DING owners concurrently for the same identity.

Native DING watches the recipient inbox and delivers a normalized notice:

```text
[DING] new st2 message: [id:<rand6>] <subject> (from <sender>); check your inbox
```

Consumers must key on the `[DING]` prefix and stable id, not descriptive words. Every maintained
harness uses the same transport: normalize untrusted fields into bounded, single-line printable
text, positively identify an empty current Codex or Claude composer, and send one bracketed-paste
sequence without Return. The sidecar then observes for a short bounded window and sends a separate
bare Return only after two immediately adjacent inspections show the exact notice in a positively
idle composer. A human draft, active turn, modal, changed composer, unreadable screen, command
timeout, or unknown renderer defers submission. Once a paste command starts, the sidecar retains
ownership and retries by inspection only, so a timeout cannot duplicate the paste. This measured
screen heuristic is fail-closed for the maintained renderer versions but is not an evented TUI
contract; renderer changes can defer delivery and remain an explicit design gap.

Agents must declare `busy` before actively executing work and return to `available` only when
yielding or ready for new work, but `busy` never suppresses DING. Fresh `dnd` is the only delivery
hold. The sidecar does not refresh `dnd`, so an abandoned hold becomes stale after 15 minutes and
delivery resumes. New arrivals remain FIFO, same-filename archive receipts shadow and clean restored
inbox duplicates, and failed or uncertain PTY operations retain the notice for safe retry. Unsafe
delivery retries use a bounded backoff, so an active composer cannot make the sidecar spawn a fresh
PTY probe on every inbox poll. On start
or restart, the sidecar first adopts an exact staged recovery/backlog notice when present, then sends
one generic check-inbox recovery DING if unread work remains; it does not replay every backlog
message.

Both DING and the catalog supervisor use filesystem events only as an early-wake optimization.
Create, modify, rename, and remove events wake them; read/open access events do not. Their own inbox
and catalog reads therefore cannot self-trigger a Linux inotify loop, and the bounded timer remains
the correctness fallback.

## Cleanup

Explicit teardown is the only operation that ends declared tasks:

```sh
st2 down --catalog "$CATALOG" --host <host>
```

On Linux, remove the supervisor service after teardown when it is no longer wanted:

```sh
st2 service uninstall
```

## Command surface

```text
ls, up, down, validate, doctor
message, ding, agents, status, context, resource
env, pty, shell, pretrust
hooks, service, eval
compile-agent (experimental)
completions
```

`st2 completions <shell>` emits completions from the live command tree. No generated completion or
manpage tree is committed.

## Clean-room verification

The test suite builds a temporary `PATH` containing only the current `st2` binary, required Git,
and `pty`, `codex`, and `claude` shims. It installs and verifies a scratch hook receipt, instantiates
both maintained hand-authored KDL examples in fresh Git workspaces, validates and materializes them
twice, and verifies the help/doctor/native authoring surface without a predecessor transport binary:

```sh
cargo test --test native_only --all-features
```

Run the complete local gate with:

```sh
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-targets --all-features
```

## Eval contract

The sole canonical agent contract is
[`AGENT-SPEC.md`](https://github.com/compoundingtech/evals/blob/main/AGENT-SPEC.md) in the evals
repository. Eval corpus definitions, execution/readiness evidence, authorization, and results belong
to that repository; st2 does not duplicate or pin its ledgers here.

`st2 compile-agent` remains experimental. Hand-authored KDL is the canonical st2 authoring
interface, and generated output must be reviewed before materialization.
