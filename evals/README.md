# Local eval corpus

This repository keeps an st2 and an st3 form of each migration eval.

An st3-only eval can prove a new runtime feature that st2 does not implement.

The initial st2 corpus came from `compoundingtech/evals` commit `3db48ab56d40ce27dfd94f89d2db9b692d93836a`.

Future imports require an explicit eval review before they enter this corpus.

The [source eval migration review](./MIGRATION-REVIEW.md) classifies all 58 active evals in the old eval repository.

The License MIT, Restart continuity, and Claude Skill Inheritance pairs use Claude Sonnet in both runtimes.

The Ghost bug, Signal rename, Fork in the road, Poisoned pull request, Test Writing, and Weird Git Setup pairs use Codex.

The ten remaining pairs are model-free.

Mission Inputs, Local File Refresh, and Constraint Inheritance are also model-free.

Run Generation Revision starts one Codex planner through the launch API.

The st3 corpus has 42 evals. Twenty-four are model-free, and eighteen use at least one model.

Each eval KDL starts with a document version. A missing version means version zero.

st2 accepts versions zero and one. st3 accepts version two.

## Harness inventory

The seat counts include every native agent seat. The LLM judge counts are separate.

| st2 | Ghost bug | Codex × 2 | None |
| st2 | Signal rename | Codex × 4 | None |
| st2 | Restart continuity | Claude Sonnet × 2 | None |
| st3 | License MIT | Claude Sonnet × 2 | Codex × 1 |
| st3 | Ghost bug | Codex × 2 | Codex × 1 |
| st3 | Signal rename | Codex × 4 | Codex × 1 |

The paired and st3-only corpus has 12 Claude seats, 40 Codex seats, one Pi seat, and one OMP seat. It also has three Codex LLM judges.

The twenty-four model-free st3 evals add no model seats and no LLM judges.

All Claude seats use `claude-sonnet-5`.

Model agents must use a native `harness` block. A setup or fixture process can use `command`.

Codex `gpt-5.6-sol` is the default model judge.

An eval can use a Claude judge for a specific reason. Record the choice in this inventory and the run report.

## Small Talk message discipline

The graph owns planned work, assignment, dependencies, progress, products, and judgement state.

An eval does not author a harness prompt. st3 supplies the normal boot contract.

Put mission work in goals and steps. Keep only stable repository facts in `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or a persona file.

Do not disable harness features or reveal held-out gate criteria in agent instructions.

st3 sends one durable Small Talk message when an assigned parent becomes ready.

Inherited nested steps use the parent message. A nested step sends a new message only when its assignee changes.

The native driver transports a graph message. It does not create a second message source.

An agent sends a direct message for a blocker, an exception, a requested result, or explicit coordination work.

An agent does not send routine progress when graph work state already expresses that progress.

An eval that tests coordination must judge the required Small Talk message sequence.

An eval must keep enough work state in the graph to survive an agent or daemon restart.

## Run reports

Each eval run gets one concise Markdown report in its eval folder.

Use `reports/YYYY-MM-DD-<run-id>.md`. Copy [run-report-template.md](./run-report-template.md) as the starting form.

Record exact values when the runtime exposes them. Mark an unavailable value and give the reason instead of estimating it.

Commit the report with the run evidence. Do not leave the only report in terminal output or temporary state.

## Validation

```sh
st2 eval ./evals/st2/license-mit
st2 eval ./evals/st2/network-smoke
cargo test -p st3 --test examples
```

st3 eval orchestration is exercised through repository integration controllers and is deliberately
not a public CLI command. The Rust test validates every st3 fixture against the normative grammar
and its structural contracts. Paid live runs must use an explicit development controller so the
public product CLI does not acquire an unfenced raw-fixture launcher.
