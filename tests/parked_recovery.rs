//! #204 against the real binaries and real processes: a fail-mode task crash-loops into a terminal
//! park, `st2 tasks` reports the fault, `st2 unpark` clears exactly that task, and a healthy peer
//! keeps the same pid and generation throughout.
//!
//! `tests/run.rs` proves the same recovery deterministically against a fake runner, which is the
//! CI-gated proof. This one exists for the claim that a fake runner structurally cannot make: that
//! *no supervisor-wide restart occurred*. A pid and a process generation that survive the whole
//! episode are the only direct evidence of that, and they require real processes.
//!
//! Note that `st2 up --once` cannot appear here. Both single-pass entry points build a fresh
//! `FlappingCap`, so a one-shot reconcile can never park anything; the park is a property of a
//! long-running supervisor, and this test drives a real one.
//!
//! Every wait is on an observed condition with a deadline, never a fixed sleep standing in for one.
//! `XDG_STATE_HOME` is a temp dir, so nothing here can read or clear a real host's parks.
