//! agent-spec — read a catalog of rendered agent declarations.
//!
//! One agent is one declarative file, Nomad-style: the agent is the job and its `pty`/`exec` blocks
//! are the tasks. This crate owns the two halves any reader of that catalog needs and nothing else:
//!
//! - [`spec`] — the shared model a declaration lowers to ([`AgentSpec`], [`Task`], [`Resource`], …).
//! - [`discovery`] — the catalog walk: parse every `*.{kdl,toml,json}` that looks like a
//!   declaration, and resolve each one's `identity`/`host` with the catalog's precedence rule
//!   (content wins, the path supplies defaults, a mismatch is a warning).
//! - [`declared`] — the strict, source-located canonical KDL document. It preserves the complete
//!   typed node tree and duplicate occurrences for publication and downstream policy checks.
//!
//! KDL is the canonical on-disk format; TOML and JSON lower to the runner model. Consumers that need
//! declared shape use [`DeclaredDocument`]; consumers that need resolved runtime meaning use
//! [`discovery`]. Both flow through the same KDL parser.
//!
//! st2 consumes this crate, which is what keeps it a reference implementation rather than a copy:
//! a second reader (a TUI, a linter) sees exactly the fields the runner sees, including the ones
//! the runner's roster JSON does not carry (`supervisor`, `role`, `workspace`, `host`).
//!
//! The runner-normalized model deliberately drops render-only fields. [`DeclaredDocument`] retains
//! them without assigning policy, so st2 stays render-agnostic while policy consumers do not need a
//! second parser.

/// Source revision of the complete public parser and lowering contract.
///
/// Hermetic builds inject the full source revision. Native builds use the full clean Git revision
/// or an explicit `local-dirty.*`/`local.unknown` identity, so unlike builds cannot compare equal.
