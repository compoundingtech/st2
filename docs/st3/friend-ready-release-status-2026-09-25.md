# Friend-ready candidate status — 2026-09-25

**Release hold.** Candidate `0da07d7` is deployed to both active hosts, but the
default 24-hour idle and 72-hour bidirectional delivery gates have not elapsed.
Do not describe the friend-ready trial as released until both reports pass and
their retained evidence is reviewed. The continuously running gate watcher
notifies the standing st3 operator of post-due transitions; it does not turn a
short diagnostic into release evidence.
The [friend trial handoff](friend-trial-handoff.md) is staged for that review,
not an invitation to start the trial while this hold is active.

Monitoring commit `8817b15` adds an early post-rollout evidence preflight. It
notifies the operator of a bad sample, PID change, stale host, or excessive gap
before the 24-hour deadline, with retry after a failed notification send. The
preflight is currently healthy; it cannot pass the release gate.
Watcher update `cfe036f` also sends an early CPU-risk notice after two hours
and 60 quiet intervals per host if the unchanged CPU limits are exceeded. It
is installed on Hetz; its own fixture test and first service run passed. The
24-hour report remains the authority.

## Candidate and recovery proof

- Each daemon restart was preceded by a normalized ACK from the independent COS
  seat. Rollback binaries are retained locally on the corresponding host.
- After the final restart, both doctors passed; both signed peers were up with
  zero pending, invalid, or unhealthy replication records. Exact linked message
  receipts passed Silber-to-Hetz in 24 seconds and Hetz-to-Silber in 22 seconds.
  COS independently confirmed both seat incarnations remained reachable and a
  new message reached it natively through the restarted Silber daemon.
- The live Hetz trace before `326904a` saw about 16,328 preparations of the same
  mailbox version SQL in 10 seconds. After the change, that SQL was absent from
  the top 20 preparation counts in an equivalent 10-second trace. The previous
  harness-history fix reduced its hot query from roughly 198,000 to roughly 150
  SQLite steps per 10 seconds. These are path-specific traces, not availability
  or whole-system benchmarks.
- `8866c11` limits work-wake reconciliation to indexed sent-message candidates
  with work tags while retaining closed attempts. The focused regression and
  full st3 test suite passed. `0da07d7` additionally limits deadline wake-history
  enrichment to the next ready item for each local agent. The parity regression
  and full st3 test suite passed. Their effect on whole-daemon idle CPU is still
  being measured by the new post-rollout window.

## Product checks

- `cargo test -p st3`, `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, both soak-report fixture
  tests, `cargo test -p stui`, and the TUI PTY smoke passed.
- `nix build .#st3 --no-link` passed on packaging commit `3cdbe84`, including
  its release-profile tests and the `stui` suite; `checks.x86_64-linux.st3-help`
  passed for the packaged commands. The packaged `st3`, `st`, and `st3-migrate`
  binaries ran with this shell's non-Nix allocator preload removed from their
  environment; the inherited preload is not compatible with the Nix runtime.
  The package also contains the pinned `pty` executable. An isolated,
  local-only daemon started from the package and passed every doctor check,
  including PTY runtime discovery, before it was stopped. The packaged `stui`
  passed normal exit, SIGTERM restoration, navigation latency, and a
  stalled-connection PTY smoke against the live daemon. Its debug-only panic
  restoration check passed separately on the debug binary.
- Live TUI bootstrap was 121 ms and full snapshot 437 ms against the local
  daemon. All six iOS logic tests and the TypeScript typecheck passed. Prior
  signed Debug simulator and paired-gateway proofs remain the device evidence;
  a physical iPhone installation is optional for this mission.
- The earlier `326904a` build had a three-minute **diagnostic only** with no
  sample errors, unchanged daemon PIDs, and quiet median CPU of 13.3% on Hetz
  and 17.4% on Silber. Those figures must not be attributed to `0da07d7` or
  used to pass the default gate.

## Pending release evidence

- The post-rollout two-host idle window begins with the first final Silber PID
  sample at 2026-09-25 03:14:09 UTC. The unmodified report cannot pass before
  2026-09-26 03:14:09 UTC. It must show one stable PID per host, no missing or
  bad samples, enough quiet intervals, CPU within the stated limits, and flat
  last-hour RSS relative to the first hour.
- The complete-failure-logging delivery monitor began at 2026-09-24 22:50:25
  UTC. Its unmodified 72-hour report cannot pass before 2026-09-27 22:50:25
  UTC. It requires at least 400 exact receipts per direction, no failures or
  excessive gaps, and an active, current monitor.
- Keep inspecting peer status, last successful exchange, and errors throughout
  the soak. The current status API does not expose exact live TCP dial counts;
  the retained-client regression proves connection reuse in a focused TCP test,
  not an invented production counter. The earlier
  [idle baseline](idle-stability-2026-09-23.md) is not a matched 24-hour window.
- Long-running Fabric `exec` clients were observed hanging after remote
  commands had stopped, while short commands and st3 signed replication kept
  working. The Fabric owner has requested a graph-queued diagnosis and
  regression; this operator-path issue remains open rather than being silently
  counted as a passed st3 messaging check.

The exact gate definitions and override rules are in the
[friend-ready delivery gate](friend-ready-delivery-gate.md). Any failure is a
release hold requiring diagnosis and a new complete window after remediation;
do not delete evidence or lower thresholds to obtain a pass.
